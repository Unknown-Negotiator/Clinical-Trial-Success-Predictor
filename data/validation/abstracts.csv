<b>Background:</b> The landscape of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has improved significantly recently. However, there is still lack of studies to evaluate whether the combination of neoadjuvant immunotherapy plus TP regimen is safe and effective in down-staging to reduce the extent of surgery in locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (LA OSCC). <b>Methods:</b> In this exploratory study, eligible patients with untreated locally advanced, resectable OSCC (T3-4bN0-3M0; stage III-IVb, AJCC 8th Edition) were enrolled to receive Tislelizumab (200mg) and platinum-doublet chemotherapy[albumin-bound paclitaxel (240 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) plus cisplatin (70 mg/m<sup>2</sup>)] on day 1 Q3W for three cycles, followed by surgery and postoperative adjuvant therapy. After neoadjuvant therapy, the TNM stage was re-evaluated by MR. Surgery was performed according to the new stage with R0 resection. Adjuvant therapy was based on pathologic staging. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST1.1 during neoadjuvant treatment, major pathologic response (MPR), progress-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. An additional health-related quality of life analysis was performed before and after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, to evaluate the effect of the changed extent of surgery for quality of life of patients according to the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N 35. <b>Results:</b> Between February 2023 and November 2024, 20 pts were enrolled. Median age was 44.5 (18-71) yrs, and 80% male. All pts completed neoadjuvant therapy. 20 pts received surgery with 100% R0 resection rate. 14 pts were allowed for reductions in the extent of surgery. The combination of tislelizumab and TP regimen did not increase the incidence of adverse events, and no treatment-related adverse events for grade 3/4 were observed. A significant improvement in dysphagia, eating and pain symptoms in all patients after treatment, indicating that the treatment can improve the quality of life of patients without the risk of aggravating other symptoms. Symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and functional indicators to deterioration significantly during treatment, probably due to treatment-related adverse reactions. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current findings, along with acceptable safety and reduction in the extent of surgery, suggests that tislelizumab combined with TP regimen represents a potential treatment for LA OSCC. But the evaluation of response and long-term efficacy is still needed collected and follow-up. <a>Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2200064609</a>.",Head and Neck Cancer,ChiCTR2200064609

<b>Background:</b> Locally advanced vulvar cancer is a rare but lethal disease more common in underserved populations. In contrast to other gynecologic cancers, the incidence and mortality of this disease has increased over the past decade. Treatment for locoregional disease involves surgery and chemoradiation, while systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy are reserved for patients with distant metastases. Cisplatin and radiation (cis-RT) have been reported to have anti-tumor immunomodulatory properties in addition to their cytotoxic effects. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibitors could synergize with chemotherapy and improve outcomes for this disease. <b>Methods:</b> In this single-arm phase II trial (NCT04430699), patients with primary unresectable, incompletely resected, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva undergoing RT were eligible. Patients who had received prior chemotherapy were also eligible. Patients received cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly concurrently with intensity modulated (IM) RT, and pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered every three weeks for a total of 12 cycles. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR), and the secondary objective was six-month recurrence free survival (RFS). PD-L1 expression and T-cell receptor beta clonality were assessed among other translational endpoints. An ORR ≥ 60% was considered worthy of further study. <b>Results:</b> The study closed to accrual on 10/11/2024 after 24 patients had enrolled. Twenty-two patients (92%) had primary unresectable disease and two (8%) had recurrent disease. All patients were treated with definitive intent RT, with a median dose to the primary of 68.4 Gy (range, 26.2, 70.2) and 45 Gy to pelvic, inguinal, vulva CTV (range, 21.6, 50.4). One patient stopped RT early due to disease progression. At the data cutoff on 01/22/2025, the ORR (CR+PR) was 75%. The 6-month RFS rate was 70% (95% CI: 48 – 85%). The median PFS has not been reached. Any grade adverse events (AE) occurred in all patients. Grade (G) 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 19 (78.6%) patients, most of which were related to cisplatin. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea (88%), diarrhea (71%), fatigue (67%) and anemia (50%). There were 6 serious AEs, only 2 of which were related the treatment (both AKI). Most immune related toxicities were G1/2, except for G3 diarrhea (4%). Immune mediated colitis led to discontinuation in 1 patient (4%). PD-L1 (CPS ≥ 1) was positive in all patients. There was an increase in mean TCR clonality after 2 cycles. <b>Conclusions:</b> The study met its primary endpoint. Concurrent treatment with chemoradiation and pembrolizumab improved ORR and 6-month RFS in vulvar cancer. The addition of pembrolizumab did not lead to any unexpected AEs. Chemoradiation with pembrolizumab could be considered in patients with primary unresectable or incompletely resected vulvar cancer. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04430699"">NCT04430699</a>.",Gynecologic Cancer,NCT04430699

<b>Background:</b> AVPC have limited therapeutic options and a dismal prognosis. Although early data indicate that adding carboplatin (Carb) to cabazitaxel (Cab) benefits men with AVPC, responses are short-lived. In a previous study (NCT03263650) a subset of AVPC patients had long-term responses to CabCarb induction followed by PARP inhibitor maintenance. Tumor tissue analyses revealed upregulation of inflammatory and immune pathways in post-CabCarb treated tumors from prolonged responders. We therefore hypothesized that adding anti-PD-1 (cetrelimab, Cet) would increase the efficacy of CabCarb induction plus niraparib (Nira) maintenance in AVPC patients, and that correlates would expose tumor cell intrinsic and microenvironment pathways implicated in therapy response and resistance. <b>Methods:</b> In a single-institution study, men with CRPC meeting ≥ 1 of 9 AVPC criteria (listed in <a href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04592237"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04592237</a>) and ECOG performance status 0-2 received 6 cycles of Cab 20-25mg/m<sup>2</sup> and Carbo (AUC 3-4). Cet (360mg) was added to Cycles 2-6 of CabCarb. Men completing 6 cycles without progressive disease (PD) were randomized 1:1 to Nira 300mg BID ± Cet. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) in randomized patients. Subgroup comparisons between patients with PD in the first 6 cycles (Early PD) vs. patients who achieved randomization (Randomized) were made with chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Paired tumor biopsies were obtained after 1 cycle of CabCarb and 2 cycles of CabCarbCet. <b>Results:</b> 120 patients started CabCarb. Their median age was 68 years (30-83). Most were White/non-Hispanic (78%) and had not received prior docetaxel (58%). Of the 120, 20 (16.7%) went off study for reasons other than PD and 40 (33.3%) had Early PD and were not randomized. The Early PD group did not differ from the Randomized group in terms of age, race ethnicity, prior docetaxel, or baseline PSA. Post randomization median follow up was 20.5 months; median PFS was 3.4 months (95% confidence interval: 2.0, 4.4) with Nira (n=30) and 5.6 (3.7, 16.8) months with Nira+Cet (n=30, p=0.01); median overall survival was 10.2 (6.4, 19.6) with Nira and 24.3 (9.5, not reached) months with Nira+Cet (p=0.01). Single-cell RNA sequencing of paired biopsies revealed increased progenitor-like exhausted CD8+ T cells and decreased FoxP3+ Treg cells in Randomized patients (n=5) while Early PD patients (n=5) showed the opposite following the addition of Cet to CabCarb. <b>Conclusions:</b> A subset of men with AVPC derive meaningful benefit from the addition of anti-PD-1 to PARP inhibitor maintenance following platinum-taxane-anti-PD-1 induction. Ongoing correlates aim to identify biomarkers to select patients for this treatment strategy and reveal candidate mechanisms of resistance to guide future therapeutic combinations. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04592237"">NCT04592237</a>.","Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile",NCT04592237

<b>Background:</b> Preoperative mFOLFIRINOX is a treatment option for patients (pts) with resectable/borderline resectable (R/BR) pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). <b>Methods:</b> CASSANDRA (NCT04793932) is a multicenter phase 3 superiority trial randomizing pts ≤75y with R/BR PDAC, stratified by site and CA19.9, in a 2 by 2 factorial design to receive either PAXG (oral daily capecitabine 1250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> with biweekly cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, nab-paclitaxel 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, gemcitabine 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; arm A) or mFOLFIRINOX (biweekly 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, irinotecan 150 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>; arm B; 1<sup>st</sup> random) for either 6 months before or 4 months before and 2 months after surgery (2<sup>nd</sup> random). The results of 1<sup>st</sup> random are presented. The primary endpoint is event-free survival (EFS = absence of progression, recurrence, 2 consecutive CA19.9 increases ≥20% separated by ≥ 4 weeks, unresectability, intra-operative metastasis, death) in the intention-to-treat population (ITT). Secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), radiological, CA19.9, and pathological response rate, resection rate, toxicity, QoL in the ITT. With 173 events (260 pts) the study has a power of 80% to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at 5% two sided stratified logrank test under the alternative hypothesis of HR=0.65. EFS and OS were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test, HR estimated by Cox proportional hazard model. <b>Results:</b> Between Nov 2020 and Apr 2024, 260 eligible pts (tab 1) were randomly assigned to either arm A (N=132) or B (N=128). At data cutoff on March 1, 2025, with a median follow-up of 23.9 mos, 3y EFS was 30% (CI 20% – 40%) in arm A and 14% (CI 5% – 23%) in arm B with HR 0.66 (CI 0.49-0.89, p=0.005).

<b>Background:</b> No standard treatment exists for unresectable locally advanced (LA) or recurrent/metastatic (R/M) salivary gland cancer (SGC). Previous findings suggest that combined androgen blockade (CAB) provides promising clinical activity in patients with androgen receptor (AR)-positive SGC. However, no AR-targeted drug is currently approved for SGC. This multi-center phase 2 study investigated two approaches in patients with unresectable LA or R/M SGC: darolutamide monotherapy followed by the combination of darolutamide and goserelin. In the monotherapy phase, darolutamide showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 20.8% as determined by independent central review (ICR) with tolerable toxicity (ASCO 2023). We now report the results from the combination phase. <b>Methods:</b> Eligible patients had histologically confirmed AR-positive LA or R/M SGC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0–2, adequate organ function, and no local therapy options. Patients received darolutamide orally at 1,200mg daily, combined with goserelin at 3.6 mg every four weeks. The primary endpoint was ORR by ICR in patients verified to have AR positivity through central assessment. Secondary endpoints included clinical benefit rate (CBR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profiles. <b>Results:</b> Between Sep 2022 and Aug 2023, 33 patients were enrolled in the combination phase. Median age was 63 years; 26 were male; ECOG PS 0/1/2 in 28/4/1. Histology included salivary duct carcinoma (n=32) or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (n=1). Prior treatment included surgery (n=23), radiotherapy (n=21), and chemotherapy (n=15). The ORR by ICR was 45.2% (14/31; 95% CI, 27.3–64.0), meeting the primary endpoint. CBR was 51.6% (95% CI, 33.1–69.8), and DCR was 64.5% (95% CI, 45.4–80.8). At a median follow-up of 13.7 months, the median PFS was 13.1 months (95% CI, 2.0– not calculable [NC]). Thirteen patients continued treatment at the data cutoff (August 9, 2024). Median OS was not reached (95% CI, 20.0–NC), and 12 months OS rate was 87%(95% CI, 68.9–94.9). Treatment was generally well tolerated, with six patients (18.2%) experiencing grade 3 adverse events. <b>Conclusions:</b> This is the first prospective CAB trial in SGC which has met its primary endpoint. Darolutamide plus goserelin demonstrated clinically meaningful efficacy and a favorable safety profile, suggesting it may be a compelling option before initiating chemotherapy, which can significantly diminish a patient’s quality of life. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05694819"">NCT05694819</a>.",Head and Neck Cancer,NCT05694819

<b>Background:</b> Outcomes in patients with rGBM are poor, with historical median overall survival (OS) of 6-9 months. Here we report the results from the dose exploration phase of a phase 1 trial investigating ICV-delivered, bivalent CAR T-cells targeting EGFR epitope 806 and IL13Rα2 in rGBM. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with EGFR-amplified GBM that was recurrent/progressive following front-line radiotherapy were enrolled using a 3+3 design (dose levels: 5.0 x 10<sup>6</sup>, 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup>, and 2.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells). Patients underwent surgery for (1) maximal safe resection and confirmation of viable tumor and (2) Ommaya reservoir placement. Post-operatively, patients received a single ICV dose of CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. Primary endpoints included dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary endpoints included objective radiographic response, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS. Serial CSF samples were analyzed for CAR T-cell pharmacokinetics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). <b>Results:</b> Eighteen patientsreceived CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells (n=6 per dose level). Median age was 57, 15 (83%) were male, 13 (72%) had MGMT unmethylated tumors, and 7 (39%) had &gt;1 prior relapse. One DLT (grade 3 lethargy/fatigue) was observed at the MTD (2.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells). Acute neurotoxicity related to CAR T-cells occurred in all patients. Using immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) grading, 10 of 18 patients (56%) experienced grade 3 neurotoxicity; none had grade 4-5 neurotoxicity. Using tumor-inflammation associated neurotoxicity (TIAN) grading, 2 of 18 patients (11%) had grade 3 and 1 patient (6%) had grade 4 neurotoxicity. Grade 1-2 fever occurred in all patients. Eleven of 13 patients (85%) with measurable disease at time of CAR T-cell infusion experienced tumor shrinkage, ranging from 1-62% reductions (median 35%, IQR 12 – 39%) in target lesions and with one confirmed partial response by modified RANO criteria. PFS and OS continue to mature and will be presented. CAR T-cell expansion in CSF was robust with a dose-response relationship observed. The CAR transgene remained detectable in CSF and blood 12 months post-CART infusion in a patient experiencing durable stable disease lasting for 17 months (ongoing at data cut-off). In patients undergoing repeat resection following treatment, CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cell infusion markedly increased the number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. scRNAseq in post-treatment CSF revealed higher cytotoxicity and exhaustion scores in CD8+ CAR T-cells as compared to the infusion product, indicative of target cell engagement. <b>Conclusions:</b> ICV delivery of CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 is feasible and appears safe. CART-EGFR-IL13Rα2 cells are bioactive and exhibit an encouraging early efficacy signal in rGBM. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05168423"">NCT05168423</a>.",Central Nervous System Tumors,NCT05168423

<b>Background:</b> Radical cystectomy (RC)is the standard treatment forBCG unresponsive high-risk (HR) NMIBC patients (pts). Pembrolizumab (Pem) was approved by the FDA based on Keynote-057 (41% complete response rate (CRR)) and offers a non-surgical option for pts who decline or are ineligible for RC. Nadofaregene firadenovec and Nogapendekin alfa inbakicept have been recently approved in this setting. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) in the TROPHY-U-01 trial. Combining ADCs with immunotherapy showed promising results in mUC. We hypothesized if the combination of sasanlimab (Sa), a subcutaneous (SC) anti-PD1 agent, and SG would improve the CRR of Pem in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC pts who refuse or are ineligible for RC. <b>Methods:</b> SSANTROP is a phase II study conducted across 18 sites in Spain to assess the CRR at 3 months (mo) of the combination of Sa (5 cy of Sa 300 mg SC on day 1 every 28 days) plus SG (7 cy of SG 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and every 21 days) in BCG unresponsive HR NMIBC. Pts achieving CR at 3 mo received maintenance therapy: Sa 300 mg SC every 28-day for up to 2 years. Primary endpoint was CRR at 3 mo with plan for percentage of response assessment maintained at 12 and 15 mo. Key eligibility criteria: ECOG PS 0-1, histologically confirmed BCG-unresponsive HR NMIBC, refusal or ineligibility for RC, urothelial carcinoma histology, and no prior anti-PD1/L1 or anti-CTLA-4 therapy. The sample size of 116 pts was calculated to demonstrate a 53% CRR for the combination, based on a Pem historical control of 41% (one-sided alpha 0.05, power 82%). Design was modified to finally include 40 pts based on a change in the treatment landscape of UC. <b>Results:</b> As of January 21, 2025, 59 pts were screened, and 41 initiated treatment and were included in the safety analysis. Among them, 32 (78%) male, median age of 70.6 years (SD 7.8). Types of BCG-unresponsive disease included: persistent/recurrent CIS alone or with recurrent HG Ta/T1 within 12 mo post-BCG (22 pts, 53.7%), recurrent HG Ta/T1 within 6 mo post-BCG (16 pts, 39%), and T1 HG disease at first evaluation post-induction BCG (3 pts, 7.3%). The most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (58.5%), asthenia/fatigue (58.5%), alopecia (41.5%), neutropenia (36.6%), anemia (24.4%) and stomatitis (22%). Most common grade ≥ 3 AEs included neutropenia (9 pts, 22%), febrile neutropenia (5 pts, 12.2%). G-CSF prophylaxis was implemented as of 09/2024. As of 12/2024 and based on 25 evaluable pts, CRR at 3 mo was 68% (17/25). <b>Conclusions:</b> This trial is the first to evaluate the combination of Sa and SG in BCG-unresponsive HR-NMIBC. With preliminary 3 mo CRR of 68%, the safety analysis identified no unexpected concerns, with severe AEs mainly involving neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. No treatment related toxic deaths occurred. <a>Clinical trial information: 2022-002998-28</a>.",Genitourinary Cancer—Kidney and Bladder,2022-002998-28

<b>Background:</b> HIV-associated Kaposi’s Sarcoma (KS) is a rare malignancy associated with Human Herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) in people living with HIV. Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) blockade may lead to anti-tumour immune reconstitution. <b>Methods:</b> Starkap (NCT05646082) enrols patients (pts) with well-controlled HIV and anti-retroviral (cART) refractory KS to receive 4-weekly dostarlimab 500 mg for 4 cycles followed by 6-weekly 1000 mg for up to 1 year. Study objectives are safety per CTCAE v.5.0 and efficacy by ACTG criteria. Funding and Product for this study was provided by GSK. <b>Results:</b> As of 12/2024, 10 of 13 pts were evaluable for safety and efficacy at cycle 4 (C4). All pts were cisgender male, median age was 56 (IQR:49-60); HIV-viral load (VL) was &lt; 200 copies/ml in all; median CD4 count: 622 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>(IQR:494-800). Four had high-risk KS (oedema/ulceration). One pt was chemo-naïve; the median number of treatment lines was 2 (range:0-10). All pts had &gt;1 adverse event (AEs), 4 of grade &gt;3. Treatment-related AEs occurred in 7 pts, all of grade 1-2 and not requiring steroid. At C4, objective response rate and disease control rate were 30% and 90%, respectively. HHV-8 DNA declined at C4 (208 vs 41 copies/ml, p = 0.035), with no HIV-VL or CD4 changes. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of paired screening/C4 tumour samples (N = 10), demonstrated a significant enrichment in pathways associated with interferon type I, chemokine receptors activation, NFkb and TLR cascade at C4, and marked enrichment in immunoglobulin transcripts in non-responders. Immune deconvolution showed increased T-regs (p = 0.035) and decreased macrophages (p = 0.048) at C4. A non-significant rise was seen in NK, CD4, and CD8 naïve cells. Non-responders had higher B-naïve/CD4 memory infiltration and lower NK and monocyte at baseline. ImmunoSeq-based TCRbeta-chain sequencing of paired screening/C4 tumour and blood samples identified 9 clones in matched screening/C4 bloods and tumour, expanded in both compartments throughout treatment. Of these, according to public datasets (IEDB), 6 had unknown antigen specificity, 1 targeted HBV, and 2 targeted CMV. In all but 2 patients, a total of 39 new intra-tumoral clones were detected at C4, with 37 of unknown specificity. Of the remaining 2, 1 was specific for SARS-CoV-2, and the other one for EBV and CMV. <b>Conclusions:</b> Dostarlimab is tolerable and has anti-tumour activity in cART-refractory KS, mirrored by longitudinal HHV-8 DNA decline. Translational analyses suggest post-treatment changes in the tumour microenvironment, with PD-1 inhibition driving pre-existing T-cell clonal expansion and intra-tumoral generation of new clones. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05646082"">NCT05646082</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05646082

<b>Background:</b> The Neoadjuvant Immuno-Radiotherapy Trial (NIRT-2) is a phase II study, conducted at 2 institutions, that evaluated in patients (pts) with locoregionally advanced HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) whether the combination of neoadjuvant sequenced, lymphatic sparing stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) delivered to gross tumor volume (GTV) plus pembrolizumab is effective in enhancing major pathologic response (MPR) compared to historical controls of anti-PD-1 alone. <b>Methods:</b> 27 pts with resectable clinical stage III-IVA HPV-negative HNSCC who would warrant adjuvant RT per the investigators were enrolled. Neoadjuvant therapy consisted of SBRT 8Gy X 3 delivered over 1 week (GTV +/-3mm) followed by 3 cycles of pembrolizumab (200mg) prior to definitive surgical resection + neck dissection at week 7. Standard of care adjuvant RT +/- chemotherapy was administered based on pathologic staging, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab for 6 months (14 doses). The primary endpoint was MPR (defined as &lt;/=10% viable tumor cells), assessed using a single-arm Simon Two-stage design to test the hypothesis that SBRT would improve MPR to pembrolizumab from 22%, rejecting the null hypothesis if 10 or more responses (37%) are observed in 27 pts (Type 1 error 5%, 90% power, alternative rate 50%). Secondary endpoints included pathologic down-staging allowing for surgical de-escalation and omission of adjuvant RT. <b>Results:</b> The study completed enrollment (N=27) on January 17, 2025, at which time 22 pts had completed surgery. 22/27 (81%) pts enrolled were clinically staged as T3/T4 and 8/27 (30%) were N2b/c (AJCC 8th Ed). Pathologic down-staging was observed in 16/22 (73%) pts, which permitted surgical de-escalation (no tracheostomy or free flap, &gt;50% organ preservation) in 11 pts (50%). 16/22 (73%, one-sided 95% CI =53%-100%, p&lt;.0001) had a MPR, of which 6 had a pathologic complete response (pCR), thus meeting the study's primary endpoint of 10 MPR. Adjuvant RT was omitted in 17/22 (77%) pts. All pts remain disease-free at a median follow-up of 8.5 months (IQR=3.9, 21.2; range=0-32). <b>Conclusions:</b> Neoadjuvant sequenced, lymphatic sparing SBRT followed by pembrolizumab led to notable pathologic down-staging allowing for surgical de-escalation and omission of adjuvant RT. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04938609"">NCT04938609</a>.",Head and Neck Cancer,NCT04938609

<b>Background:</b> Unresectable stage III NSCLC patients with large tumor volumes remain challenging. Our previous retrospective study has showed promising results of induction chemoimmunotherapy before definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for these patients. Here we report preliminary results of the randomized phase II study on this regimen. <b>Methods:</b> This InTRist study is a randomized, single-center, phase 2 trial, enrolling patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC with bulky diseases, and without <i>EGFR/ALK</i> alterations. Bulky diseases were defined as primary tumor ≥5 cm in greatest dimension or metastatic lymph nodes ≥2 cm in shortest diameter. Eligible patients were 1:1 randomly assigned to receive induction toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks) plus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy for 2 cycles (toripalimab group) versus induction chemotherapy alone for 2 cycles (chemo group) followed by concurrent CRT (60 Gy radiotherapy plus concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy). All patients without disease progression or grade ≥2 pneumonitis after CRT received consolidation toripalimab (240 mg every 3 weeks) for up to 12 months. Randomization was stratified according to histologic type. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05888402. <b>Results:</b> BetweenJanuary 20th, 2023 and October 8th, 2024, 52 patients were randomized to induction toripalimab (n = 27) or chemo (n = 25) groups. By the data cutoff date (January 15th, 2025), the median follow-up was 13.1 months. Induction toripalimab plus chemotherapy exhibited significantly longer PFS compared to chemotherapy alone (median not reached [NR] vs NR; hazard ratio 0.25 [95% CI, 0.07-0.90], <i>P</i>=0.034). The 12-month PFS rate was 89.4% (95% CI, 76.0%-100%) in the toripalimab group and 57.8% (95% CI, 40.7%-81.9%) in the chemo group. Objective response rate after induction therapy was 77.8% (21/27) for the toripalimab group and 40.0% (10/25) for the chemo group (median tumor reduction 32% vs 21%). Grade 2 pneumonitis occurred in 26.9% (14/52) of all patients, with 18.5% (5/27) in the toripalimab group and 36.0% (9/25) in the chemo group. Grade 3 pneumonitis occurred in 7.7% (4/52) of all patients, with 11.1% (3/27) in the toripalimab group compared to 4.0% (1/25) in the chemo group. No grade 4-5 pneumonitis. <b>Conclusions:</b> Induction toripalimab plus chemotherapy, followed by concurrent CRT and consolidation toripalimab, demonstrated potentially improved short-term efficacy and manageable toxicity for patients with bulky unresectable stage III NSCLC.

<b>Background:</b> Platinum-based chemotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of TNBC. Our previous research has demonstrated the superiority of nab-paclitaxel/cisplatin (AP) regimen as the initial treatment for metastatic TNBC(mTNBC; <i>Xichun Hu, 2020ESMO)</i>. Camrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1. Herein, we conducted this prospective, single arm, open-label phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of camrelizumab in combination with AP regimen as the first-line treatment of mTNBC (NCT04537286). <b>Methods:</b> Patients with untreated mTNBC received camrelizumab (200 mg D1), nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m<sup>2</sup> D1,D8) and cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> D1) intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR),overall survival (OS) and safety. Exploratory analyses included immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing of archival tumour samples. <b>Results:</b> A total of 90 patients were enrolled. Overall, median age was 51 years; 46.7% of patients had three or more metastatic sites; 78.9% of patients had visceral involvement; 82.2% of patients had taxanes exposure. As of data cutoff (July 10th 2024), median duration of follow-up was 18.1 months. Median PFS was 11.8 (95%CI 10.1-13.6) months and median OS was 27.1 (95%CI 22.1-33.6) months. ORR was 71.1% and DCR was 86.7%. Median time to response was 1.5 months. TRAEs were reported in all patients while grade 3-4 TRAE occurred in 55.6% patients, including neutropenia (34.4%), leukemia (24.4%), and anemia (10.0%). irAEs were reported in 57.8% patients, including RCCEP (45.5%), rash (11.1%), pneumonitis (10.0%), while grade 3-4 irAEs only occurred in 4.4% patients. Three-months landmark analyses showed that patients with irAE have significantly longer OS than those without (29.3 vs. 22.1 months, <i>P</i> = 0.018). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that patients with PDL1 CPS ≥10 had significantly longer PFS (13.7 vs 11.4 months, <i>P</i> = 0.039). Patients with high TILs had significantly longer OS (23.1 vs.10.3 months, <i>P</i> = 0.003). The proportion of PDL1 positive (CPS ≥1) patients was 81.8% in basal compared to 0% in non-basal subtype (<i>P</i> = 0.023). Hallmark pathway analysis showed that the activation of DNA repair pathway (HR,11.6, 95%CI 2.4-55.7, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and MYC target pathway (HR,7.4,95%CI 1.9-28.2, <i>P</i> = 0.004) was significantly associated with shorter PFS, while the activation of KRAS signaling (HR,3.2, 95%CI 1.1-9.7, <i>P</i> = 0.035) was significantly associated with worse OS. <b>Conclusions:</b> Camrelizumab plus AP as first-line treatment in patients with mTNBC demonstrated satisfying efficacy with manageable toxicity.

<b>Background:</b> Long-term follow-up of the SOFT and TEXT randomized trials has shown persistent reduction of recurrence from inclusion of OFS in adjuvant endocrine therapy, and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival (OS) among patients at higher baseline risk of recurrence. We report a final update after a median follow-up of 15y in SOFT and 16.6y in TEXT. <b>Methods:</b> SOFT and TEXT enrolled premenopausal women with HR+ early BC from November 2003 to April 2011 (2660 in TEXT, 3047 in SOFT intention-to-treat populations). TEXT randomized women within 12 weeks of surgery to 5y E+OFS vs T+OFS; chemotherapy (CT) was optional and concurrent with OFS. SOFT randomized women to 5y E+OFS vs T+OFS vs T alone, within 12 weeks of surgery if no CT planned, or within 8 months of completing (neo)adjuvant CT. Both trials were stratified by CT use. The primary endpoint was disease free survival (DFS) which included invasive local, regional, distant and contralateral breast events, second non-breast malignancies and deaths. Secondary endpoints included invasive breast cancer-free interval (BCFI), distant recurrence free interval (DRFI) and OS. 20y data collection was completed in Q4’2024: 80% of surviving patients had final follow-up during or subsequent to 2020, for 70% it was during 2023-2024. 15y Kaplan-Meier estimates and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs are reported. <b>Results:</b> There were 815 DFS events and 388 deaths reported in SOFT; and 669 DFS events and 325 deaths in TEXT. In SOFT, a moderate DFS benefit of T+OFS vs T (HR 0.85; 0.72-1.00) persisted, however 1/6 DFS events were not BC related; BCFI benefit was HR 0.82 (0.69-0.98). E+OFS vs T further reduced DFS events (HR 0.73; 0.61-0.86). The 15y DFS in SOFT was 67.0% for T, 70.5% for T+OFS and 73.5% for E+OFS. There were consistent but non-significant decreased hazards of death for T+OFS vs T (HR 0.87; 0.68-1.10) and E+OFS vs T (HR 0.85; 0.67-1.08). 15y OS was 85.3%, 86.7%, 86.9% respectively. For the TEXT+SOFT combined analysis of E+OFS vs T+OFS (n=2346 vs 2344) DFS, BCFI and DRFI continued as significantly improved for E+OFS over T+OFS. 15y DFS was 74.9% vs 71.3% (HR 0.82; 0.73-0.92). 15y OS was 87.8% vs 87.0% (HR 0.94; 0.80-1.11) respectively. 15y estimates by CT use are tabulated. <b>Conclusions:</b> The high level 15y final results of the SOFT and TEXT confirm a role for OFS- and aromatase inhibitor-containing adjuvant endocrine therapy for premenopausal women.

<b>Background:</b> Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with poor prognosis. A potential strategy for overcoming therapeutic resistance involves the development of novel therapies that target cancer stem/initiating cells. Our previous research demonstrated that metformin (MF), an antidiabetic drug, induces the differentiation of stem-like glioma-initiating cells and suppresses tumor formation via AMPK-FOXO3 activation (Stem Cells Transl Med, 2012). We conducted a phase I/II study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of MF combined with standard maintenance temozolomide (TMZ). Our phase I findings indicated that MF at doses of up to 2,250 mg/day combined with maintenance TMZ was well tolerated (Cancers, 2022). Here, we present the complete results of the phase I/II study. <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged 20–74 years with supratentorial GBM, Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70, and a history of initial chemoradiotherapy with TMZ were eligible. During the phase II study, patients received MF monotherapy for 14 days, followed by six cycles of TMZ combined with daily MF (2,250 mg) for 365 days. The primary endpoint was the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate from the initiation of chemoradiotherapy with TMZ (target; one-sided alpha 10%, power 70%, threshold 1-year PFS, 27%; expected 1-year PFS, 50%, based on the historical EORTC/NCIC study (Stupp et al, 2005)). <b>Results:</b> From 2021–2023, 22 patients were enrolled in 5 hospitals and 21 patients received TMZ combined with daily MF. The cohort included 12 men and nine women, with a median age of 50 years (32–69 years). According to the WHO 2016 classification, the initial histology revealed 18 IDH-wild-type and 3 IDH-mutant GBMs. The 1-year PFS was 47.6 % (90% CI; 29.2–64.0), achieving the primary endpoint. The 2-year overall survival rate was 54.5%. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included lymphocytopenia (19%), thrombocytopenia (4.8%), appetite loss (4.8%), body weight loss (4.8%), nausea (4.8%), and seizures (4.8%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Maintenance therapy with 2,250 mg/day of MF combined with TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM is promising. A phase III study comparing MF combined with TMZ vs. TMZ alone for the treatment of GBM is planned. <a>Clinical trial information: jRCTs031200326</a>.",Central Nervous System Tumors,jRCTs031200326

<b>Background:</b> Immunotherapy has been used in hormone receptor positive (HR+) HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and has shown modest clinical response and improved clinical benefit rate (CBR). Capecitabine has shown immunomodulatory activity by increasing interferon-gamma from activated tumor infiltrating immune cells, thus inducing PD-L1 expression. Therefore, patients may derive clinical benefit from the combination of capecitabine with cemiplimab. In our published preclinical studies, immunotherapy with activated lymphocytes administered a few days before chemotherapy to pre-sensitize the tumor and its microenvironment demonstrated substantial tumor cell death and response compared with a single agent alone. We hypothesize that timing and sequencing are important for a successful combination strategy. <b>Methods:</b> This is a phase I, single-arm, prospective trial for patients with HR+/HER2- MBC without prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy. The study was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center between October 2021 and October 2023. Patients received a fixed dose of cemipilimab IV 350 mg on day 1 in combination with Capecitabine orally twice daily for 14 days on and 7 days off starting on day 3 of a 21-day cycle. Patients were started at capecitabine 800 mg/m2 and if well tolerated then increased to 1000 mg/m2. The primary endpoint was an analysis of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), CBR, and progression free survival (PFS). <b>Results:</b> Thirteen eligible patients with HR+/HER2- MBC were enrolled. The median age was 57 years (46-70 years), 11 were Caucasian, 1 was Black/African American and 1 was Asian/Pacific Islander. All patients had progression on prior endocrine treatment (1 to 6 lines of treatment, mean 2.6) and 92.3% had received prior treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor. The most common adverse events were hand and foot syndrome (30.8%, n = 4) followed by cough, decreased absolute neutrophil count, thromboembolic event, and dyspnea which occurred each in 15.4% (n = 2) patients. Only 1 immune related event of dry mouth (sicca) was seen (7.7%). A partial response (PR) was seen in 2 patients (15.4%), stable disease (SD) in 6 patients (46.2%) and progressive disease (PD) in 5 patients (38.5%). Median PFS is 4.1 months (95% CI 2.8 – NR). The ORR was 15.4% (95% CI: 4.3% - 42.3%), and the CBR was 61.5% (95% CI: 35.5% - 82.3%). 2 patients (15.4%) derived long term responses who continued treatment beyond 2 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study found that the sequence of cemiplimab in combination with capecitabine had an acceptable safety profile. No unexpected adverse events or DLT were seen. Patients derived a reasonable clinical benefit from the combination treatment. 2 patients derived long term responses beyond 2 years. Further studies and biomarker analysis are warranted to explore this combination and improve patient selection. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05064085"">NCT05064085</a>.",Breast Cancer—Metastatic,NCT05064085

<b>Background:</b> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with microvascular invasion (MVI) or portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) is associated with a high risk of tumor recurrence after radical resection. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely used as an adjuvant treatment in China; however, its efficacy in combination with targeted therapies, such as lenvatinib, remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of TACE combined with lenvatinib in preventing recurrence in HCC patients with MVI or PVTT (Cheng's Classification I/II) after radical surgery. (ChiCTR2000040863). <b>Methods:</b> This is a single-center, prospective, non-randomized cohort study. Patients who underwent radical resection of HCC with MVI or PVTT (Cheng's Classification I/II) were enrolled. The patients received lenvatinib (8mg qd for weights &lt; 60kg and 12mg qd for weights≥60kg) in combination with TACE (Len+TACE) or TACE alone. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS), and secondary endpoints included adverse events (AEs), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related mortality. <b>Results:</b> A total of 74 patients were included in the study, 37 patients in each group. The median age was 59.5 years (range from 30 to 75 years). Most patients were males (78.3%) and 57 patients were HBV related (77.0%). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the baseline clinicopathological characteristics including gender, age, HBV background, liver function, tumor characteristic and AFP level. The media RFS was 27.5 months (95% CI: 20.5-NA) in the Len+ TACE group, which was significantly longer than 16.2 months (95% CI: 10.2-NA) in the TACE group (P = 0.04; HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.27-0.98). The median OS was not reached in both groups. The 1-year and 2-year OS rates for the Len+ TACE group were 96.9% (95% CI: 91.0-100.0) and 85.3% (95% CI: 72.8-99.9), respectively. The 1-year and 2-year OS rates for the TACE group were 94.6% (95% CI: 87.6-100.0) and 73.8% (95% CI: 57.1-95.3), respectively. The most common AEs was hypertension in the Len+TACE group (10.8%). No treatment-related mortality was observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of lenvatinib and TACE significantly prolonged RFS in HCC patients with MVI or PVTT (Cheng's Classification I/II) after radical resection, with no significant treatment-related AEs. These findings suggest that TACE combined with lenvatinib may be an effective regimen to prevent tumor recurrence in this high-risk population. <a>Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2000040863</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",ChiCTR2000040863

<b>Background:</b> Doublets with Fluoropyrimidines (F), oxaliplatin (Ox), and irinotecan (Ir) are standard chemotherapy agents used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (mCCR). The role of triplet combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in refractory patients (pts) previously treated with doublets or monotherapy sequential regimens remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> This single-arm, open-label phase II trial employed a Simon two-stage design. Eligible pts had mCCR with documented progression after treatment with doublets or sequential monotherapy regimens containing F, Ox, and Ir. Pts with RAS wild-type tumors were required to be refractory to anti-EGFR therapy. The mFOLFIRINOX regimen consisted of 5-FU (2400 mg/m², continuous infusion over 46 hours), Ox (85 mg/m², D1), Ir (150 mg/m², D1), and leucovorin (200 mg/m², D1), administered every 14 days. The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR) as assessed by RECIST v1.1. According to the Simon design, the study would be considered positive if 4 or more pts achieve disease control among 25 pts in the second stage. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. <b>Results:</b> Between October 2021 and October 2024, 25 pts were enrolled. Three pts did not receive treatment due to consent withdrawal (n = 1) or clinical deterioration from disease progression before treatment initiation (n = 2). All pts had proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) tumors; 16 (64%) had KRAS/NRAS mutations, and most tumors were left-sided (n = 20, 80%). At Intention to Treat analyses, 16.6% (n = 4) achieved a partial response, 44% (n = 11) had stable disease, and 28% (n = 7) experienced disease progression as their best radiologic response. The DCR was 60% (n = 15), and the ORR was 16.6% (n = 4). With a median follow-up of 6.8 months, 17 pts experienced disease progression or death. The median PFS was 5.7 months, and the median OS was 9.3 months. No significant differences in DCR, ORR, PFS, or OS were observed based on RAS mutation status or tumor sidedness; among 22 pts who received at least one cycle of mFOLFIRINOX, 68.1% (n = 15) experienced grade 3 or higher adverse events, including one treatment-related death. <b>Conclusions:</b> mFOLFIRINOX demonstrated efficacy as a rescue regimen for refractory mCCR previously refractory to doublets or sequential monotherapy regimens containing Ox, Ir, fluoropyrimidines, and anti-EGFR therapy. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05354817"">NCT05354817</a>.",Gastrointestinal Cancer—Colorectal and Anal,NCT05354817

<b>Background:</b> TSN1611 is a novel small molecule KRAS G12D inhibitor targeting both active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) forms of KRAS G12D protein. TSN1611 showed high potency and selectivity against KRAS G12D mutant tumor cells in vitro and effectively inhibited tumor growth in several pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer models (NSCLC) in vivo. <b>Methods:</b> A phase 1/2 study of TSN1611 was developed to enroll patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12D mutation. The study comprised a phase 1a dose escalation part following a BOIN design with accelerated titration to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose and pharmacokinetics (PK), followed by a phase 1b part for dose optimization to compare different recommended doses and a phase 2 part to evaluate the efficacy of TSN1611 across various tumor types. Alternative dose levels or regimens could be explored based on the emerging data. Pts received oral TSN1611 twice daily (BID), until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Here we report the preliminary data from phase 1a part. <b>Results:</b> As of Jan 05, 2025, 18 pts received TSN1611 from 50 to 600 mg BID (9 with CRC, 5 PDAC, 2 NSCLC, and 1 each with ampullary cancer and gallbladder cancer, all with pre-identified KRAS G12D mutation). Median age was 61 years (range 36-81). The median prior lines of systemic therapy were 3 (range 1-6). No dose-limiting toxicity was reported and MTD was not reached. The most common (≥ 10%) treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 or 2 vomiting (44.4%), nausea and diarrhea (38.9% each), fatigue (16.7%), ALT increased, blood CPK increased, hyperkalemia and hyperuricemia (11.1% each). No treatment related grade 3 or higher AE or SAE was reported. Four (30.8%) out of the 13 evaluable pts demonstrated stable disease per RECIST v1.1. Tumor reductions were observed in 3 pts (CRC, PDAC, and NSCLC, n = 1 each) at 200 or 400 mg BID, with treatment ongoing. Serial assessment of plasma ctDNA revealed declines in KRAS G12D variation allele frequency at 200 mg BID and above, echoing that the exposure at 200 mg BID reached that of ED<sub>90</sub> in the CRC GP2D model. TSN1611 was rapidly absorbed with T<sub>max</sub> around 2 hours and half-life around 15 hours. The PK profile indicated a general dose proportionality in exposure across the evaluated dose ranges and low to moderate accumulation after multiple BID dosing. Dose escalation is ongoing, and more data will be available at the conference presentation. <b>Conclusions:</b> TSN1611 was well tolerated, demonstrating acceptable PK characteristics as predicted, with preliminary tumor shrinkage observed in pts with refractory KRAS G12D mutant tumors. Phase 1b/2 studies are planned to evaluate TSN1611 both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard of care and/or novel agents treating cancer. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06385925"">NCT06385925</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology,NCT06385925

<b>Background:</b> Gemcitabine (G) and nab-paclitaxel (nP) are standard 1L regimen for patients (pts) with unresectable PC, yet the efficacy remains unsatisfactory. K is a humanized bispecific antibody targeting PD-L1/CTLA-4, while S is a kinase inhibitor of VEGFR1-3, FGFR1 and CSF-1R with immune-regulatory potential. It is hypothesized the add-on of S and K to GnP chemotherapy would provide improved efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> This single-arm, phase 1b/2 trial enrolled pts with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic PC who were eligible for 1L treatment. The phase 1b part was designed in a ""3+3"" algorithm to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of S for dose expansion in phase 2 part. Pts received oral S at escalating dose starting from 200 mg qd, plus intravenous K at 5 mg/kg on day 1, and GnP chemotherapy on days 1 and 8 at 21-day cycles. The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) within the first 28 days for phase 1b, and ORR per RECIST 1.1 for phase 2. Secondary endpoints included DCR, PFS, OS, safety, and efficacy-related biomarkers. <b>Results:</b> As of Dec 19th, 2024, 18 pts were enrolled with a median age of 54 (range: 41-74), predominantly male (16/18) and metastatic disease (15/18). Of the 16 pts with genetic testing, <i>KRAS</i> (15/16) and <i>TP53</i> (11/16) mutations were common, followed by DNA damage response (DDR) -related mutations (7/16) including <i>ARID1A</i>, <i>ATM</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, etc., while TMB-H (1/16) is rare, and none had MSI-H or dMMR status. Within the 9 pts from phase 1b part (3 in S 200 mg cohort, 6 in S 250 mg cohort), no DLTs occurred thus the RP2D of S was determined as 250mg qd. In the 16 evaluable pts, the best overall responses were 1 CR, 10 PRs and 5 SDs. The ORR was 68.8% and the DCR was 100%. 2 pts received R0 resection after 6 cycles' treatment. With a median follow up of 7.43 months, the estimated median PFS was 8.25 (95% CI: 4.57-NR) months and the 6-month PFS rate was 72.9%. Estimated median OS was 11.14 (95% CI: 5.52-NR) months and the 6-month OS rate was 82.5%. In the exploratory analysis, DDR-related mutations seemed predictive for better ORR (85.7% vs 55.6%, <i>P</i>= 0.308), PFS (6-month PFS rate:100% vs 53.3%, log-rank <i>P</i>= 0.519), and OS (6-month OS rate:100% vs 62.5%, log-rank <i>P</i>= 0.116). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 14 (77.8%) pts, and most common TRAEs (≥20%) included leucopenia (44.4%), hypertension (38.9%), and thrombocytopenia (22.2%). TRAEs of grade ≥3 included leucopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertension (n = 2 [11.1%] for each). There were no treatment-related deaths. <b>Conclusions:</b> These preliminary results showed encouraging anti-tumor efficacy and an acceptable safety profile of S plus K and GnP chemotherapy as 1L treatment for advanced PC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05832892"">NCT05832892</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",NCT05832892

<b>Background:</b> Tasurgratinib is an orally available selective inhibitor of FGFR1-3 tyrosine kinase and is approved in Japan for biliary tract cancer with <i>FGFR2</i> fusions or rearrangements based on a global phase 2 study. We previously identified <i>FGFR</i> gene alterations that are highly sensitive to tasurgratinib using a high-throughput functional evaluation method (MANO method) (npj Precision Oncology [2021] 5:66). We conducted a single-arm, investigator-initiated multicenter phase 2 basket trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tasurgratinib in patients (pts) with advanced solid tumors harboring<i> FGFR</i> gene alterations, including alterations identified by MANO method. <b>Methods:</b> Pts with advanced solid tumors with <i>FGFR</i> gene alterations detected by next-generation sequencing assays received tasurgratinib 140 mg QD. Pts were allocated to each Group based on <i>FGFR</i> gene alteration (Group A: <i>FGFR1-3</i> fusion, Group B: <i>FGFR1-3</i> sensitive mutations to tasurgratinib determined by MANO methods, Group C: <i>FGFR1-3</i> activating mutation not applicable to group B or <i>FGFR1, 2</i> gene amplification, Group D: cholangiocarcinoma with <i>FGFR2</i> fusion and previous treatment with a FGFR inhibitor except for tasurgratinib). The primary endpoint for Groups A, B, and C was objective response rate (ORR) by independent central review (ICR). Group D was an exploratory cohort, and ICR was not performed. The secondary endpoints included ORR by investigator assessment (IA), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety. The threshold and expected response rates were 5% and 30%, respectively. With the one-sided significance level of 5%, the target enrolments were 10 (62% power), 15 (87%), and 15 pts (87%) in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Group D's target number was 1 to 5 pts without a statistical hypothesis. <b>Results:</b> From June 2021 to December 2022, 46 pts were registered. The full analysis set includes 41 pts (10, 15, 15, and 1 in Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively). The most common primary sites were brain in 4 pts (40.0%) in Group A, biliary tract in 4 pts (26.7%) in Group B, and esophagus/stomach in 4 pts (26.7%) in Group C. ORRs by ICR in Group A, B and C were 20.0% (90% CI: 3.7-50.7, p = 0.0861), 20.0% (90% CI: 5.7-44.0, p = 0.0362), 6.7% (90% CI: 0.3-27.9, p = 0.5367), respectively. ORRs by IA in Group A, B, C, and D were 20.0% (95% CI: 2.5-55.6), 40.0% (95% CI: 16.3-67.7), 13.3% (95% CI: 1.7-40.5) and 0.0% (95% CI: 0.0-97.5), respectively. Median PFS by IA in Groups A, B, C, and D were 2.5 (95% CI: 1.4-5.7), 7.2 (95% CI: 1.7-8.2), 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-3.7) and 5.7 months (95% CI: not evaluable), respectively.

<b>Background:</b> Tracheostomy is a common intervention for managing airway obstruction in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (H&amp;N SCC), which can significantly affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This study evaluates and compares HRQoL outcomes in Tracheostomized H&amp;N SCC patients receiving metronomic therapy (methotrexate and Celecoxib) versus cisplatin-based Radiochemotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> This comparative study included Tracheostomized patients aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with metastatic, or advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (H&amp;N SCC). Eligibility criteria required a Karnofsky Performance Score of at least 70. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either metronomic therapy (methotrexate and Celecoxib) or cisplatin-based Radiochemotherapy. HRQoL assessments were conducted using validated EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H&amp;N35 questionnaires. Data were collected at baseline and subsequently every three weeks over a six-week period. The analysis focused on key domains, including pain, swallowing, speech, fatigue, and emotional well-being, to evaluate the treatment impact on patients' quality of life. Analysis was done using SPSS V. 26 and P-value 0.05 was considered significant. <b>Results:</b> A total of 50 patients were enrolled (metronomic: 25; cisplatin: 25). Both groups showed improvements in HRQoL over time, with metronomic therapy yielding better results in specific domains. Pain scores improved by 18% in the metronomic group compared to 12% in the cisplatin group at week 6 (p = 0.031). Swallowing difficulties decreased by 15% in the metronomic group versus 8% in the cisplatin group (p = 0.042), while speech-related challenges showed a 10% improvement in the metronomic group compared to 6% in the cisplatin group (p = 0.049). Fatigue scores improved by 13% in the metronomic group versus 9% in the cisplatin group (p = 0.038). Emotional well-being also increased significantly, with a 14% improvement in the metronomic group compared to 10% in the cisplatin group (p = 0.045). While overall HRQoL scores at the study’s end were comparable between groups, metronomic therapy showed superior symptom control and fewer adverse effects, enhancing its tolerability. <b>Conclusions:</b> Metronomic therapy (methotrexate and Celecoxib) demonstrated significant advantages over cisplatin-based Radiochemotherapy in improving HRQoL domains like pain, swallowing, and speech in Tracheostomized H&amp;N SCC patients. These findings underline the importance of HRQoL-focused treatment planning for advanced cancer patients.",Head and Neck Cancer,

<b>Background:</b> Debio 0123 is an oral, brain-penetrant, highly selective WEE1 kinase inhibitor currently being investigated in several clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors both as monotherapy and in combination. <i>In vitro</i>, Debio 0123 can inhibit and induce cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and inhibit P-gp. <b>Methods:</b> A physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model using Simcyp Population Based Simulator was developed for Debio 0123 to evaluate its perpetrator effect on sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 and P-gp. A second model was developed for etoposide as victim drug. Both were combined to assess the risk of clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) between Debio 0123 and etoposide. Plasma etoposide concentrations were simulated following single and three daily doses of etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV administered concomitantly with, or without, 520 mg oral (PO) Debio 0123. The Debio 0123 model was developed using<i> in vitro</i> and clinical data from previous Debio 0123 clinical trials. <b>Results:</b> No clinically significant DDIs were predicted between Debio 0123 given for 3 consecutive days and the CYP3A4 probe substrate, midazolam. When PO or IV administration of midazolam was simulated, the 90%CI of the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for AUC<sub>inf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, alone versus in combination with Debio 0123, entirely fell within 0.9 and 1.3. A weak DDI was predicted towards the P-gp probe substrate dabigatran etexilate. When given orally, AUC<sub>inf</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> GMR of dabigatran with, or without, Debio 0123 were 1.87 and 1.93, respectively. Administration, for 3 consecutive days, of Debio 0123 combined with IV etoposide was predicted to have no effect on etoposide exposure (90%CI of GMR for both AUC and C<sub>max</sub> within 0.80-1.25). Accordingly, the design of Debio 0123-SCLC-104 trial with Debio 0123 administered in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (NCT05815160 - ASCO 2025 # 495064) was developed with standard doses of IV etoposide. To confirm the absence of DDI, PK samples were collected in the trial. No major changes were noted in the observed etoposide exposure across Debio 0123 dose levels (200 to 400 mg) after one or three days of co-administration in adult SCLC participants that recurred or progressed after previous platinum treatment. Etoposide PK observed in the study was also in line with literature data (US label Etopophos 2011). Debio 0123 PK was consistent with data previously reported for monotherapy (Abstract #3120 ASCO 2024). <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, these results indicate that there is no relevant PK interaction between Debio 0123 and IV etoposide. For concomitant medications that are P-gp substrates, only a weak DDI is expected with Debio 0123. Furthermore, the absence of significant DDIs predicted with CYP3A4 substrates suggests that Debio 0123 can be combined with a wide range of therapies. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05815160"">NCT05815160</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology,NCT05815160

<b>Background:</b> The prognosis of patients with neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) depends mainly on the proliferation index (Ki67). Patients with NEN G1 and G2 frequently survive many years, while those with NEN G3 often die within 12 months after diagnosis. For patients with NET G1/G2, a few approved treatment options are available, while for NEN G3 the choice is very limited. Among NEN G3, those with a Ki67 of &gt; 60% respond well to platinum-based chemotherapies, while there is no trial-proven treatment option for slower-proliferating G3 tumors. The CABONEN study evaluates the tyrosine kinase inhibitor Cabozantinib, which has shown striking activity in NEN G1/G2, in NEN G3 with a Ki67 up to 60%. Here we present the efficacy and tolerability outcomes of the second per-protocol planned interim analysis. <b>Methods:</b> CABONEN represents a prospective, single-arm, multicenter phase II trial investigating the efficacy and safety of Cabozantinib in NEN G3 patients with a Ki67 between 20% and 60%. Primary endpoint is disease control rate (DCR) after 6 months; secondary endpoints include DCR after 3 and 12 months, progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), time on medication (TOM), quality of life, and toxicity. <b>Results:</b> From December 2021 to December 2024, all 45 planned patients (21 female, 24 male) were enrolled although not all patients have reached 6 month of treatment for the primary endpoint. Of these, 39 patients had NET G3, and 6 patients had NEC Ki67low. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years (40 to 84 years). The primary tumor location was the pancreas in 53.3% (24), the GI tract in 20% (9) lung in 11.1% (5), and others in 15.5 % (7). The median Ki67 was 31% (21% to 60%). Twelve patients were therapeutically naïve (26.7%), 13 had received 1 prior therapy (28.9%) and 20 had received 2 or more therapeutic lines (44.4%). The primary end point DCR at 6 months was 83% and at 3 months 92.1% The best objective response rate was 19.5% and the median PFS was 9.7 months. During therapy, a total of 105 SAEs were observed including 74 SAE grade 3, 1 SAE grade 4, and 4 SAE grade 5, with SAEs being ileus, acute pain, cholangiosepsis, infection, small intestinal perforation, or stroke. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board could not find any new and unexpected (S)AEs and recommends continuation of the study. <b>Conclusions:</b> At interim analysis, Cabozantinib represents a safe and effective treatment option in patients with low proliferative NEN G3. The CABONEN study will continue to the next planned analysis. <a>Clinical trial information: EudraCT Number: 2020-002541-41</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",NCT05138952

<b>Background:</b> Most patients with central nervous system (CNS) malignancy develop cognitive impairment, fatigue, and mood-related symptoms that are impacted by cancer and treatment, including radiation therapy. We currently have limited therapies to mitigate neurocognitive toxicity. It is important to accurately assess neurocognitive function and symptom burden when working to establish therapeutics. The objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of therapies aimed at improving neurocognitive function and quality of life by leveraging a decentralized approach incorporating an established digital neurocognitive assessment tool and development of a remote symptom collection/medication log to improve capture of longitudinal neurocognitive data. <b>Methods:</b> This is an open-label decentralized clinical trial (NCT06377696) that randomizes patients who have received intracranial radiation for primary and secondary brain tumors in a 1:1 allocation to health promotion with a wearable device +/- metformin (targeting radiation-related toxicity). Remote symptom collection is reported through digital patient surveys. Medication adherence is being monitored through a digital medication log developed for the study. Remote neurologic examination is performed by clinical neuro-oncologists at telehealth visits. Participants perform serial remote cognitive assessments with an established digital neurocognitive testing platform – Mayo Test Drive (MTD). Cognitive assessments and symptom surveys were designed to be completed on a smartphone, tablet, or computer device. <b>Results:</b> The study started enrollment on May 31, 2024. As of January 27, 2025, 54 of 100 planned participants have enrolled (27 on each arm). 51 participants remain active on trial; 3 withdrew from trial participation (2 prior to treatment, 1 after treatment). The overall completion rate for a quality-of-life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) is 85.0%, and each dose of metformin logged is 78.5%. The overall completion rate for virtual neurologic examination and short test of mental status is 94.7%. For MTD, the overall completion rate is 97.9%. The average MTD session duration was 16 minutes. Most participants completed MTD testing using a smartphone (90.5%) at home (89.1%). <b>Conclusions:</b> These results provide preliminary support that a decentralized trial assessing neurocognitive outcomes is feasible in patients with CNS malignancy. The completion rates of questionnaires and objective cognitive evaluation are comparable or higher than expected with historic norms. Final study results will provide real-world cognitive and quality-of-life data for patients with CNS tumors while providing preliminary data on the effectiveness of device-based health promotion +/- metformin for treatment related cognitive decline. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06377696"">NCT06377696</a>.",Care Delivery/Models of Care,NCT06377696

<b>Background:</b> Anti-VEGF antibodies combined with chemotherapy remain first-line treatment for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), but no randomised trials have evaluated oral VEGFR-TKI plus chemotherapy in this setting. <b>Methods:</b> In this Chinese multicenter, randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, treatment-naïve RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC patients with MDT-assessed unresectable metastases were 1:1 randomised to receive anlotinib (12mg, QD, days 1-14) or bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg, IV, day 1), both combined with oxaliplatin (130mg/m², IV, day 1) and capecitabine (anlotinib group:850mg/m2, bevacizumab group 1000mg/m², BID, days 1-14) in 3-week cycles. After 4-8 induction cycles, maintenance therapy with anlotinib or bevacizumab plus capecitabine continued until progression/unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were tumor location (right/left) and prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes/no). Primary endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS (non-inferiority margin HR≤1.09); secondary endpoints included investigator-assessed PFS, ORR, DCR, DoR, OS, liver metastases resection rate, and quality of life. With one-sided α=0.025 and 81.2% of power, 524 PFS events were required. <b>Results:</b> Between May 25th, 2021 to August 30th, 2023, 748 patients were randomly assigned and included in the intention-to-treat population, with 373 in anlotinib group and 375 in bevacizumab group. Patients had a median age of 59.0 years (IQR, 53.0-67.0) and 227 (30.35%) of all 748 patients were female. The median follow-up was 25.10 months (95% CI, 23.82-26.25). The median IRC-assessed PFS in anlotinib and bevacizumab group were 11.04 months (95% CI, 9.82-11.17) and 11.04 months (9.69-11.17), respectively, with HR 1.00 (0.84-1.18). Serious adverse events occurred in 143 (38.34%) of 373 patients in anlotinib group, and in 129 of 375 (34.40%) patients in bevacizumab group. <b>Conclusions:</b> In unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC patients, anlotinib plus CapeOX showed comparable PFS time and safety compared with bevacizumab plus CapeOX. The results provide a new treatment option for unresectable RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC patients. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04854668"">NCT04854668</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-485208-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-485208-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Anlotinib plus CapeOX (n=373)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Bevacizumab plus CapeOX (n=375)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">HR (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ORR (95% CI), %</td><td>61.93% (56.79-66.88)</td><td>62.13% (57.01-67.06)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">DCR (95% CI), %</td><td>92.76% (89.64-95.18)</td><td>93.07% (90.01-95.42)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Median DoR (95% CI), months</td><td>9.66 (8.31-9.99)</td><td>9.69 (8.48-11.01)</td><td>1.04 (0.84-1.27)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Resection rate of liver metastases, %</td><td>3.75%</td><td>2.93%</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Grade ≥3 TEAE, n (%)</td><td>276 (73.99)</td><td>222 (59.20)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation, n (%)</td><td>30 (8.04)</td><td>34 (9.07)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">TEAE leading to death, n (%)</td><td>16 (4.29)</td><td>17 (4.53)</td><td> </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-485208-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Despite the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the majority of patients do not benefit due to inadequate efficacy as well as immune-related adverse toxicities. We have previously developed WTX-212, an erythrocyte-antibody conjugate that covalently links anti-PD-1 antibodies to erythrocyte membranes. Unlike conventional antibodies, WTX-212 accumulates in the spleen, where it effectively remodels splenic immune landscape by expanding effector T cells and reducing the reservoir of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. These changes further reprogram the tumor microenvironment and suppress tumor growth in syngeneic mouse models. Based on promising preclinical results, we have investigated WTX-212 in cancer patients resistant to checkpoint blockade therapy (NCT06026605). <b>Methods:</b> This is an investigator-initiated trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of autologous WTX-212 monotherapy in patients with advanced malignancies. The primary outcome measures include safety and tolerability according to NCI-CTCAE v.5.0. Secondary outcome measures preliminary efficacy based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. As of January 15, 2025, 14 heavily treated patients with 11 types of solid tumors, who had received PD-1/PD-L1 antibody-containing regimens as their last line of treatment but developed resistance, were enrolled. These patients received WTX-212 monotherapy in two dose cohorts (2 × 10¹¹ or 3 × 10¹¹ cells, with 6-10 mg of conjugated antibody). <b>Results:</b> Repeated WTX-212 treatment showed no DLTs or TRAEs ≥3. No patient discontinued treatment due to AEs. WTX-212 monotherapy demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity, with a DCR of 78.6% (11/14) and an ORR of 42.9% (6/14), including 1 CR and 5 PR. In the higher-dose cohort (3 × 10¹¹ cells), DCR and ORR increased to 85.7% (6/7) and 57.1% (4/7), respectively, suggesting dose-dependent efficacy. Additionally, responders (CR+PR) exhibited higher baseline levels of circulating polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) compared to non-responders (PD+SD), indicating that patients with elevated PMN-MDSCs may benefit more from treatment. Importantly, WTX-212 treatment rapidly reduced PMN-MDSCs in the peripheral blood of responders compared with non-responders, consistent with preclinical data. These preliminary results suggest that WTX-212 is safe, well-tolerated, and effective at low doses, supporting further investigation into WTX-212 monotherapy and combination therapies. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study suggests that PD-1 blockade in the spleen using erythrocyte-antibody conjugates triggers systemic anti-tumor responses while maintaining a favorable safety profile. Erythrocyte-drug conjugates represent a novel approach for targeting immune cells in the spleen, with broad implications for cancer treatment and drug development. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06026605"">NCT06026605</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT06026605

<b>Background:</b> Limitations of approved BRAF V600E inhibitors include toxicity from paradoxical activation of RAF dimerization as well as limited brain penetration. In contrast to approved agents, investigational pan-RAF inhibitors both inhibit mutant RAF proteins and wild-type (wt) RAF proteins, leading to a narrow therapeutic index. HSK42360 is a next-generation, small-molecule BRAF paradox breaker with high brain penetration. It displays significantly less paradoxical activation than approved BRAF inhibitors and spares wtBRAF-containing RAF dimers. Treatment with HSK42360 results in excellent and durable anti-tumor effect in BRAF Class I and II mutant CDX or PDX models. Here we report the interim results from a Phase 1 study of HSK42360 in patients (pts) with BRAF V600 mutations (NCT06536400). <b>Methods:</b> This multicenter, open-label, two-part study enrolled adult pts with advanced BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors, including those with recurrent or metastatic solid tumors or primary CNS tumors. Previous BRAF±MEK inhibitor treatment is permitted. In the dose-escalation (Part 1), HSK42360 (200-3600 mg/day) monotherapy was given orally. Escalation followed a “3+3 design” with dose-limiting toxicities assessed during Cycle 1. Part 2 was cohort expansion. Primary objectives were maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of HSK42360. Secondary objectives included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy. <b>Results:</b> As of January 15, 2025, 17 pts (47.1% male; median age 57.0 years) have been treated with HSK42360 monotherapy across five dose levels (200-3600 mg/day). Of these, 64.7% pts experienced adverse events (TEAEs), most frequently increased ALT (23.5%) and increased AST (23.5%). Most (89.7%) of TEAEs were grade 1. Two pts had drug-related grade 3 AEs (increased creatinine and increased ALT) and one had drug-related serious AEs (SAEs) (increased creatinine). There were no DLT, grade 4 TEAEs, treatment-related discontinuations, or treatment-related deaths. Among 11 efficacy evaluable pts, the ORR was 18.2%. Two (1 CRC and 1 ganglioglioma) had a partial response (PR) and three had stable disease (SD) with shrinkage (per RECIST or RANO). This trial is ongoing. <b>Conclusions:</b> HSK42360 monotherapy was well tolerated without unexpected safety issues. Preliminary efficacy data demonstrate favorable activity of HSK42360 in pts with BRAF V600-mutated solid tumors, including primary CNS tumors. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06536400"">NCT06536400</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology,NCT06536400

<b>Background:</b> Antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) have recently revolutionized the treatment of advanced NSCLC. RC48 is a novel ADC that carries a tubulin inhibitor targeting the HER2 protein, thereby specifically recognizing and killing these cells. It has demonstrated considerable anti-tumor effects in solid tumors. Combining ADCs with immunotherapeutic or anti-angiogenic agents may further improve outcomes for HER2-altered NSCLC. Therefore, additional investigation into combination therapies for NSCLC with HER2 alterations is warranted. <b>Methods:</b> RESOLUTION is a single-arm, phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a treatment in Pts with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring HER2 alterations. Eligible Pts who have not received prior systemic therapy will be enrolled. RC48 (2.0 mg/kg, intravenously, Q3W) combined with Tislelizumab (200mg, intravenously, Q3W) and Bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg, intravenously, Q3W) is administered until unacceptable toxicities or disease progression. The primary endpoint is the ORR, while secondary endpoints include PFS, OS, DCR, and DOR. Disease response will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST 1.1 criteria. An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 9 Pts are evaluable to determine whether to proceed; the trial will be discontinued at this stage if fewer than 2 Pts demonstrate a response. Blood samples are collected at baseline (C1D1), and on days C3D1, C5D1, and at progression (PD) for next-generation sequencing (NGS)–based, longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) mutation and methylation analyses. <b>Results:</b> From April 2024 to January 2025, 9 Pts were evaluable for efficacy. Among these Pts, 3 Pts achieved a partial response and 6 had stable disease. The confirmed ORR was 33.3%, and the median duration of response was 5.1 months. Grade 1 and 2 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 100% of Pts, and grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 22%. The most common TRAEs included proteinuria (55.5%). By January 2025, a total of 29 blood samples were collected at baseline, C3D1, C5D1, and PD timepoints. The study used PredicineCARE—a 152-gene, NGS–based ctDNA assay—and PredicineEPIC, a genome-wide ctDNA methylation assay, to longitudinally monitor genetic and epigenetic dynamics throughout treatment. The NGS analyses are ongoing. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our result suggested the combination therapy is a promising treatment strategy for NSCLC with HER2 alteration. The first-stage interim analysis revealed acceptable efficacy and manageable toxicity to support proceeding to the further stage. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06749860"">NCT06749860</a>.",Lung Cancer—Non-Small Cell Metastatic,NCT06749860

<b>Background:</b> Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous group of tumors with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and no single deﬁnitive therapeutic approach. The role of neoadjuvant alectinib in stage III ALK-positive NSCLC is still unclear. Here, we present the final analysis of the phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study aimed at investigating the activity and safety of alectinib in potentially resectable locally advanced stage III ALK-positive NSCLC patients (ALNEO trial, EUDRACT number 2020-003432-25). <b>Methods:</b> Treatment-naïve patients with potentially resectable stage III ALK-positive NSCLC, ECOG PS≤1 were registered to receive neoadjuvant alectinib for 2 cycles (8 weeks) followed by surgery and adjuvant alectinib for 24 cycles (96 weeks). The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR) by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR) by BICR, objective response (OR), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). According to the Simon’s design (P0=20%, P1=40%), 18 and 33 patients were required for the first and second stage, respectively. <b>Results:</b> A total of 33 patients were registered in 20 Italian Oncology Centers from May 2021 to July 2024. Median age was 62 years (Interquartile Range [IQR], 49–74 years), 23 (70%) patients were female and 17 (52%) were never smokers. Clinical stage according to the 8th AJCC TNM was IIIA in 21 (64%) and IIIB in 12 (36%) patients. The most represented stage was T3N2 (n=8, 24%), followed by T1aN2 (n=4, 12%), T2aN2 (n=4, 12%), T4N0 (n=4, 12%) and T4N2 (n=4, 12%). All the patients completed the neoadjuvant phase and 28 (85%) underwent surgery, which consisted of lobectomy in 21 (64%), pneumonectomy in 3 (9%) and other surgery in 4 (12%) patients. Among patients who completed surgery, R0 was achieved in 24 (86%) patients. According to the BICR, MPR was documented in 15 (46%, 90% Confidence Interval [CI]: 31%–61%) patients and pCR in 4 (12%, 95% CI: 3%–28%) patients. Overall, an OR was observed in 22 (67%) patients. Adjuvant treatment was started in 26 (79%) patients with a median interval from surgery of 5.1 weeks (IQR, 3.6–6.0 weeks). After a median follow-up of 15.2 months (IQR, 6.8–27.8 months), 31 (94%) patients were alive and 5 (19%) patients completed the adjuvant treatment. Median EFS and OS were not reached. A total of 6 (18%) patients experienced disease progression/recurrence. Grade≥3 AEs occurred in 3 (9%) and 2 (8%) patients during neoadjuvant and adjuvant phase, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> ALNEO study met its primary endpoint, suggesting alectinib as a feasible peri-operative option in resectable locally advanced stage III ALK-positive NSCLC patients.

<b>Background:</b> High-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) presents a significant mortality risk during induction therapy, primarily due to complications like disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and treatment-related toxicities. Anthracyclines, traditionally used for cytoreduction, can cause cardiotoxicity, increase DIC risk, and induce severe neutropenia. Venetoclax has demonstrated efficacy in relapsed/refractory APL. This study explored the feasibility of using venetoclax for cytoreduction in high-risk APL patients, particularly those contraindicated for anthracyclines (cardiac issues, advanced age and in select patients based on physician discretion). <b>Methods:</b> We evaluated the safety and efficacy of venetoclax in high-risk APL patients unsuitable for anthracycline-based induction therapy. Venetoclax was initiated at 100 mg and gradually increased to 400 mg over a week. Treatment duration was determined by the patient's leukocyte count, with the goal of achieving a count below 4000/mm³. All patients received standard ATRA (All-Trans Retinoic Acid) + ATO (Arsenic Trioxide) induction. <b>Results:</b> Ten patients received venetoclax for cytoreduction. The median age was 45 years (range: 26-70). The median duration of venetoclax therapy was 8 days (range:6-12). All patients achieved complete hematological remission within 31 days of induction and molecular remission by 28 days of the first consolidation cycle. Two patients experienced laboratory tumor lysis syndrome, and one developed differentiation syndrome which was effectively managed with continued venetoclax therapy. No patients required interruption of ATRA or ATO. Notably, no patients experienced prolonged neutropenia (&gt; 28 days), severe mucositis (Grade 3 or 4), cardiotoxicity, or DIC. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrates the feasibility of using venetoclax for cytoreduction in high-risk APL patients. Venetoclax effectively reduced tumor burden while minimizing the risks associated with anthracyclines. These encouraging results warrant further investigation into the potential role of venetoclax in high-risk APL to improve patient outcomes and mitigate treatment-related toxicities.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-484690-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-484690-001""><figcaption>Patient characteristics.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap"" tabindex=""0""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Patient Age/Sex</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">WBC(10^3/µL)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Platelet(10^3/µL)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Hb (g/L)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">BM blast (%)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">WBC max (10^3/µL)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">No of days venetoclax used</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Cardiac comorbidity</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Time to achieve HCR (days)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">45/M</td><td>15000</td><td>30000</td><td>9</td><td>30</td><td>25000</td><td>9</td><td>CAD</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">40/F</td><td>13000</td><td>25000</td><td>8.8</td><td>55</td><td>19000</td><td>7</td><td>NIL</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">33/M</td><td>12000</td><td>35000</td><td>8.1</td><td>45</td><td>18000</td><td>7</td><td>NIL</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">31/F</td><td>25000</td><td>45000</td><td>9.6</td><td>40</td><td>25000</td><td>9</td><td>NIL</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">65/M</td><td>17000</td><td>10000</td><td>7.5</td><td>33</td><td>19000</td><td>9</td><td>NIL</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">45/F</td><td>15000</td><td>10000</td><td>8.5</td><td>25</td><td>16000</td><td>8</td><td>RHD</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">66/M</td><td>22000</td><td>20000</td><td>9.7</td><td>60</td><td>24000</td><td>7</td><td>CAD</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">70/F</td><td>38000</td><td>25000</td><td>7.8</td><td>34</td><td>45000</td><td>10</td><td>CAD</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">46/M</td><td>16000</td><td>10000</td><td>7</td><td>33</td><td>18000</td><td>8</td><td>CAD</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">26/F</td><td>13000</td><td>45000</td><td>9.7</td><td>30</td><td>17000</td><td>8</td><td>NIL</td><td>28</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-484690-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-484690-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">BM -Bone Marrow; WBC max- Maximum WBC before starting venetoclax; CAD-Coronary Artery Disease; RHD- Rheumatic Heart Disease; HCR-Hematological Complete Response.</div></div></div></figure></div>

HLX301 is a humanized, bispecific IgG1 antibody targeting PD-L1 and TIGIT that showed anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies. A phase 1/2 first-in-human study was conducted to evaluate HLX301 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT05102214). Here we report findings from the dose escalation part (phase 1a). <b>Methods:</b> This multicenter study enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors who had failed or were intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy was available. Phase 1a evaluated doses of 0.25-15 mg/kg IV Q2W. Primary endpoints included safety, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary endpoints included PK, PD, and immunogenicity. <b>Results:</b> As of Oct 27, 2023, 9 patients were enrolled (0.25 mg/kg, 3; 1 mg/kg, 3; 2.5 mg/kg, 1; 5 mg/kg, 2). Patients were all White, 55.6% female, median age 72.0 yrs; 88.9% had metastatic disease; all had ECOG PS of 0 (44.4%) or 1 (55.6%). All patients had prior systemic cancer treatment, including 3 (33.3%) treated with PD-(L)1 blockade; 5 (55.6%) patients had ≥ 4 prior lines of therapy. All patients were included in DLT, safety, and PK analyses. Median duration of HLX301 treatment was 10.3 weeks. One patient (11.1%) in the 5 mg/kg cohort reported DLT (grade 3 cytokine release syndrome [CRS]). MTD was not determined. All patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). TEAEs leading to death occurred in 3 (33.3%) patients, none of these adverse events (AEs) were related to HLX301. Six (66.7%) patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE). TRAE of grade ≥ 3 was reported in 1 patient (11.1%; grade 3 CRS), who was also the only patient for whom TRAE led to treatment discontinuation. Treatment-related immune-related AEs occurred in 4 (44.4%) patients and treatment-related infusion-related reactions (IRRs) in 2 (22.2%). TRAEs occurring in ≥ 2 patients included IRR (22.2%) and arthralgia (22.2%). HLX301 exhibited linear PK over 0.25-5 mg/kg after single infusion and very limited accumulation after multiple infusions. Mean PD-L1 and TIGIT receptor occupancy in peripheral CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells reached saturation at 5 mg/kg. Anti-drug antibody was detected in 7 patients (77.8%). Among 8 efficacy-evaluable patients, 1 (5 mg/kg cohort) achieved partial response and 2 achieved stable disease; objective response rate and disease control rate per RECIST 1.1 were 12.5% and 37.5%, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> HLX301 showed an acceptable safety profile with preliminary anti-tumor activity. These findings could support further clinical investigation. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05102214"">NCT05102214</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05102214

<b>Background:</b> The ALNEO, NAUTIKA1, and SAKULA studies found perioperative alectinib and ceritinib were effective for resectable <i>ALK</i>-positive NSCLC. The Neo-INFINITY study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of perioperative iruplinalkib for resectable <i>ALK</i>- or <i>ROS1</i>-positive NSCLC. Here, the preliminary results of Stage 1 were reported. <b>Methods:</b> This single-arm phase II trial was conducted in China. Adult patients with pathologically confirmed resectable <i>ALK</i>- or <i>ROS1</i>-positive NSCLC at stage IB–IIIA or IIIB (T3N2M0 only), ≥one measurable lesion via RECIST v1.1, ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 were eligible. Patients received neoadjuvant iruplinalkib orally at 180 mg/day (with a 7-day lead-in at 60 mg/day) for eight weeks, followed by surgery and then adjuvant iruplinalkib (the same dose and lead-in). The total treatment period was up to two years. The primary endpoint was major pathologic response (MPR). Simon's optimal two-stage design was implemented. The study would be stopped early if ≤one of eight patients achieving MPR at Stage 1. Another 18 patients would be enrolled at Stage 2. <b>Results:</b> From Feb 2023 to Jun 2024, 10 patients were enrolled. Two are still on neoadjuvant treatment, and eight patients who completed neoadjuvant treatment and surgery were included for analysis. Median age was 59 years (range 35–78). Two (25%) were male. One (12%) had squamous cell carcinoma, and <i>ALK</i> fusions were found in six (75%) patients. MPR and pathologic complete response (pCR) were achieved in four (50%) and two (25%) of eight patients, respectively. Among six <i>ALK</i>-positive cases, four (67%) patients obtained MPR, and two (33%) reached pCR. Objective response was observed in all eight (100%) patients. Radiologic downstaging was found in four (50%) patients. All patients underwent R0 resection. During iruplinalkib treatment, ≥grade 3 iruplinalkib-related adverse events (AE) were reported in two (25%) patients, the most common of which were alanine aminotransferase increased (two [25%]) and aspartate aminotransferase increased (one [12%]). Serious AE, iruplinalkib-related AE leading to dose interruption, reduction, and discontinuation occurred in zero, one (12%), one (12%), and zero patient, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Neoadjuvant iruplinalkib is effective and feasible for resectable <i>ALK</i>- or <i>ROS1</i>-positive NSCLC, with acceptable safety profiles. Stage 2 of the study is ongoing, and long-term results are awaited. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05765877"">NCT05765877</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-486060-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-486060-001""><figcaption>Efficacy endpoints.</figcaption><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Endpoints</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">All patients (n=8)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom""><i>ALK</i>-positive patients (n=6)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Major pathologic response</td><td>4 (50%)</td><td>4 (67%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathologic complete response</td><td>2 (25%)</td><td>2 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Objective response</td><td>8 (100%)</td><td>6 (100%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Radiologic downstaging</td><td>4 (50%)</td><td>2 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">R0 resection</td><td>8 (100%)</td><td>6 (100%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-486060-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">Note: Data are presented as n (%).</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Osimertinib (Osi) has been established as a standard of care for patients (pts) with <i>EGFR</i>-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, in the FLAURA study, survival superiority of Osi over first-generation EGFR-TKIs was not demonstrated especially in Japanese pts (hazard ratio [HR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 2.34; P = 0.22). This is presumably due to the different impact of adverse events or tumor antigen-specific cytotoxicity of T cells on subsequent therapy between both EGFR-TKIs in Japanese pts. On the other hand, there has been no clinical trial comparing second- with third-generation EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, optimal first-line EGFR-TKI may not have been identified in Japanese pts. <b>Methods:</b> This was a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study to compare overall survival (OS) between initial treatment with afatinib (Afa) (n = 50) and Osi (n = 50) in pts with advanced or recurrent <i>EGFR</i>-mutant NSCLC. Exploration of immunomonitoring through peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also performed, before, during, and after treatment. The co-primary endpoints were the superiority of Afa over Osi at 3-year survival rate and the exploration of immunological biomarkers for treatment outcomes. Enrollment started in May 2020 at 28 sites in Japan with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 95 eligible pts were analyzed (47 to Afa and 48 to Osi). Objective response rates were 63.8% for Afa vs. 62.5% for Osi. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16.7 months (mos) for Afa vs. 14.5 mos for Osi (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.90; P = 0.52). Median OS was 38.8 mos for Afa and not reached for Osi (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.64 to 2.05; P = 0.64), resulting in 54.7% (95% CI, 39.4 to 67.7) for Afa vs. 57.5% (95% CI, 42.2 to 70.1) for Osi at 3-year survival rate. Predominant adverse events with Afa or Osi were diarrhea (92% vs. 31%) and pneumonitis (11% vs. 21%; Grade 5, 0% vs. 6%). Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 21% with Afa vs. 29% with Osi. The efficacy of Osi varied significantly dependent on the immunological biomarkers, Th7R (stem cell-like CD4 T cells) and Th2. Pts with high Th7R (7.83% or more) had promising PFS (31.0 mos [n = 28] vs. 6.6 mos [n = 20]; HR, 0.38; P = 0.006) and OS (not reached vs. 35.5 mos; HR, 0.56; P = 0.18). In contrast, pts with high Th2 (7.20% or more) had poor PFS (6.6 mos [n = 27] vs. 31.0 mos [n = 21]; HR, 1.78; P = 0.11) and OS (35.5 mos vs. not reached; HR, 2.77; P = 0.03). On the other hand, no immunological biomarkers affected PFS and OS of Afa. <b>Conclusions:</b> Afa and Osi both demonstrated favorable clinical activity as first-line treatment in Japanese NSCLC patients with <i>EGFR</i> mutations. Although their outcomes are comparable, immunological biomarkers (Th7R/Th2) may refine treatment decisions and warrant further prospective validation. <a>Clinical trial information: jRCTs031190221</a>.",Lung Cancer—Non-Small Cell Metastatic,jRCTs031190221

<b>Background:</b> FGFR genomic alterations occur in approximately 8% of gliomas. Inhibition of FGFR1-3 with pemigatinib showed antitumor activity in a multihistology basket trial (FIGHT-207) in which approximately 10% of participants (pts) had recurrent/progressive FGFR-altered glioblastoma (GBM). We further investigated pemigatinib activity in primary brain tumors by conducting an international, multicenter, single-arm, 2-cohort, phase 2 study specifically in adults with FGFR-altered pretreated gliomas (FIGHT-209; NCT05267106). <b>Methods:</b> Pts were enrolled in 2 cohorts: A, histologically or molecularly defined GBM; or B, other gliomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors. Eligible pts had tumors harboring a FGFR1-3 fusion/rearrangement or mutation detected by an accredited laboratory that had recurred/progressed after ≥1 prior therapy. Pemigatinib (oral, 13.5 mg on days 1-14/21) was intended to continue until progression by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria determined by an independent review committee (IRC) or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy of each cohort was evaluated independently. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR; partial plus complete) per RANO (cohort A), with a goal of &gt; 28%. Key secondary and exploratory endpoints were ORR in cohort B, ORR by investigator assessment, progression-free survival (PFS) by IRC, overall survival (OS), safety, neurologic function by Neurologic Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (NANO), and efficacy correlations with diagnosis and specific FGFR-alterations. <b>Results:</b> Between May 2022 and December 2023, 74 pts were enrolled in cohort A and 9 in cohort B. FGFR1-3 fusions/rearrangements were the most common genomic alterations in cohort A (n = 65 [88%]) and in cohort B, FGFR1 mutations (n = 8 [89%]). Pts had a median (range) age of 56 (20-79) years; 60% were male. On September 27, 2024 (data cutoff), 16 pts remained on treatment (cohort A, n = 11 [15%]; cohort B, n = 5 [56%]); 67 discontinued, primarily due to progressive disease (n = 59 [71%]). In cohort A, ORR was 8% (6 partial responses [PR], 0 complete responses [CR]); 21 pts (28%) had stable disease (SD); estimated 6-month PFS rate was 17% (95% CI, 8.7-27.8) and 12-month OS rate 48% (95% CI, 35.6-60.2). In cohort B, the ORR was 22% (1 CR, 1 PR); 3 (33%) SD. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were low grade in severity (grade ≥3, 36.1%). Hyperphosphatemia, a class effect of FGFR inhibitors, was the most common AE (75%); 6 pts (7%) required dose reduction and 4 pts (5%) discontinued due to AEs. <b>Conclusions:</b> ORR did not meet the pre-specified goal of &gt; 28% among pts with GBM harboring pemigatinib-sensitizing FGFR alterations. However, durable disease stabilization was observed, notably in pts with CNS tumors other than GBM, and toxicities were manageable. More mature PFS and OS data will be presented with exploratory molecular correlations. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05267106"">NCT05267106</a>.",Central Nervous System Tumors,NCT05267106

<b>Background:</b> Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in the resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy (ICI). Disarming Tregs could therefore restore/enhance anti-tumor responses and increase the number of patients benefiting from these treatments. EGL-001, a novel therapeutic agent, is designed to provide checkpoint inhibition by antagonizing the CTLA-4-CD80/86 interaction while selectively depleting intratumoral Tregs by downregulating CD25 and inhibiting IL-2 signaling specifically within these cells. This dual mechanism of action effectively unleashes potent anti-tumor immunity even in anti-PD-1 resistant models, independent of FcgR activity. In murine models, EGL-001 shows preferential distribution and persistence in the tumor until Treg get depleted/inactivated. Our data demonstrated complete anti-tumor activity of EGL-001 as a single agent across various tumor models and it overcomes resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment in many tumor models, highlighting its broad therapeutic potential. Additionally, EGL-001 effectively depletes Tregs and exhibits activity in ex-vivo human tumor samples, where other ICI showed no significant effect. In NHPs, EGL-001 was well tolerated across all tested doses, with rapid peripheral clearance preventing lymphoid tissue hyperplasia in the spleen and lymph nodes. <b>Methods:</b> A Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT06622486) is currently underway in eight sites in France and Spain to evaluate EGL-001 as monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in selected tumor types characterized by tumor Treg implication in induction of mechanism of resistance to ICI. The selective targeting of tumor-infiltrating Tregs could effectively improve anti-tumor immune response and limit systemic immune-related toxicities. This first-in-human, multicenter, open label Phase 1/2 study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and initial activity of EGL-001 in adult patients with selected advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors. The study consists of a Part 1 (Phase 1) dose escalation of EGL-001 administered as a single agent (from 0.3 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg), and in combination with pembrolizumab treatment, according to a BOIN design, followed by a Part 2 (Phase 2) dose expansion of EGL-001 administered at the selected doses as monotherapy and/or in combination therapy with anti-PD(L)1. Eligible patients are those who have initially benefited (secondary resistance) from an ICI treatment as monotherapy or in combination as SoC as defined by a CR, PR, or SD ≥3 months as best response by RECIST Version 1.1. As of January 2025, the first 3 Cohorts of EGL-001 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 mg/kg) have been completed. EGL-001 was well tolerated with no DLTs reported. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06622486"">NCT06622486</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT06622486

<b>Background:</b> Belantamab mafodotin (belamaf) is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)–targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated with a monomethyl auristatin-F (MMAF) payload. In DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 phase 3 trials in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), belamaf combinations significantly improved progression-free survival vs standard care, and DREAMM-7 showed significant overall survival benefit. Belantamab (GSK2857914) is the naked BCMA mAb without MMAF; therefore MMAF-related toxicities are not expected. DREAMM-20 is a phase 1/2 trial to evaluate safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of belantamab in patients (pts) with MM. We present the planned analysis of part 1 of belantamab dose escalation. <b>Methods:</b> Part 1 of DREAMM-20 (NCT05714839) is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study in pts with RRMM with ≥3 prior lines of therapy. Dose escalation was conducted using a modified toxicity probability interval method. The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events (AEs), including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR). <b>Results:</b> Across 3 cohorts, 18 pts enrolled and received belantamab 300, 900 or 2000 mg IV Q2W (n=6 each). Data cutoff (DCO) was Aug 23, 2024. Median age was 76 y (range, 42-86 y), 17 of 18 pts were triple-class exposed, and 2 of 18 pts had prior BCMA-targeted therapy. The overall median duration of exposure was 63.5 days. No DLTs or treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) leading to permanent discontinuation were reported. The most common TRAEs were infusion-related reactions and hematologic AEs (Table). Two pts had grade ≥2 corneal events per the Keratopathy and Visual Acuity (KVA) scale that were considered unrelated to belantamab. The ORR was 28% (5/18 pts; very good partial response, n=2 [900 mg]; partial response, n=3 [1 in 300 mg and 2 in 2000 mg]) with responses across all cohorts. Median duration of exposure in the 5 responders was 253 days; none of the responders had progressed as of DCO. No pts had minimal response and 28% (5/18 pts) had stable disease. Follow-up is ongoing. <b>Conclusions:</b> Belantamab showed an encouraging safety profile with no DLTs, AEs leading to discontinuation, or belantamab-related grade ≥2 corneal events. Durable responses were observed across dose levels in this triple-class–exposed population. Results support the hypothesis that belantamab provides clinical antimyeloma activity with an acceptable safety profile. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05714839"">NCT05714839</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-503934-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-503934-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">n (%)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Belantamab 300, 900, or 2000 mg (N=18)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Any-grade AEs</td><td>17 (94)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">TRAEs</td><td>12 (67)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Most common TRAEs (≥2 patients)<br/> Infusion-related reactions <br/> Neutrophil count decreased <br/> Anemia<br/> Vision blurred <br/> Platelet count decreased</td><td><br/>4 (22)<br/>4 (22)<br/>2 (11)<br/>2 (11)<br/>2 (11)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Grade ≥3 AEs</td><td>12 (67)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Most common grade ≥3 AEs (≥2 patients)<br/> Neutrophil count decreased<br/> Anemia</td><td><br/>4 (22)<br/>3 (17)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Serious AEs<br/> Treatment related</td><td>6 (33)<br/>1 (6)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Fatal AEs</td><td>0</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-503934-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Although significant advancements have been made in the treatment of neuroblastoma (NB), many patients continue to develop refractory or progressive disease. Naxitamab, a humanized anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody, has been granted approval for the treatment of recurrent or refractory high-risk NB with bone or bone marrow lesions. Based on the results that GD2 antibody induces PD-1 upregulation in a preclinical model, leading to a synergistic anti-tumor effect when combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody, our aim was to assess the outcomes of NB patients with refractory or progressive disease treated with naxitamab combined with or without sintilimab (anti-PD-1) in China. <b>Methods:</b> This was an open-label, prospective, and multicenter trial for patients with refractory or progressive NB. <b>Results:</b> A total of 34 patients were enrolled between October 26, 2021, and January 3, 2025, with a median age of 3.8 years (range, 0.7-40.3 years). Among the patients, 5 (14.7%) were diagnosed with MYCN-amplified NB, while 27 (79.4%) presented with non-amplified MYCN. Prior to enrollment, 5 patients had received autologous stem cell transplantation, while 1 patient had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. At the time of enrollment, 17 patients presented with progressive disease, while 17 had refractory disease. Treatment regimens included naxitamab+GM-CSF+sintilimab (n = 2), naxitamab+GM-CSF (n = 6), naxitamab+GM-CSF+chemotherapy (n = 12), and naxitamab+GM-CSF+chemotherapy+sintilimab (n = 14). No patients experienced grade 3-4 adverse events. One patient developed grade 2 hypothyroidism, and no sintilimab related adverse events were observed in the other patients. The median follow-up time was 14.8 months (range, 0.2–31.0). The efficacy of the treatment was evaluable in 25 patients, with the best responses being as follows: complete response (n = 12), partial response (n = 3), minor response (n = 2), stable disease (n = 6), and progressive disease (n = 2). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 85.0% and 92.0%, respectively. The DCR was 100% with sintilimab, versus 83.3% without. The 12-month progression-free survival (PFS) rates for patients with refractory and progressive disease were 79.4% and 35.6%, respectively (P = 0.014). The 12-month overall survival (OS) rates for patients with refractory and progressive disease were 92.3% and 59.3%, respectively (P = 0.054). For patients with refractory and progressive disease, those who received sintilimab therapy exhibited a higher 12-month PFS rate compared to those who did not undergo sintilimab treatment (76.9% vs. 44.2%, P = 0.059). <b>Conclusions:</b> Refractory or progressive NB is expected to benefit from the treatment regimen involving naxitamab in combination with sintilimab, though larger sample sizes are needed for validation. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06013618"">NCT06013618</a>.",Pediatric Oncology,NCT06013618

<b>Background:</b> Retreatment (re-tx) with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies offers a promising approach to extend the <i>continuum of care</i> of patients (pts) with <i>RAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i> wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with no mutations of resistance in their ctDNA at the time of treatment re-exposure. <b>Methods:</b> PARERE (NCT04787341) is an open-label, multicenter, randomized phase II trial investigating the optimal sequencing of panitumumab (pani) and regorafenib (rego) in the chemorefractory setting of <i>RAS </i>and <i>BRAF</i> wt mCRC pts, who previously derived benefit from first-line anti-EGFR-containing regimens, then received at least one intervening anti-EGFR-free line of treatment, and were prospectively selected for the absence of <i>RAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i> mutations in their ctDNA. Eligible pts were randomized 1:1 to receive pani followed by rego after progression (arm A) <i>versus</i> the reverse sequence (arm B). Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). 155 events were required to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 in favor of arm B, using a two-sided unstratified log-rank test, with type I error of 0.15 and 80% power. Secondary endpoints included 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. <b>Results:</b> From December 2020 to December 2024, 428 pts from 37 Italian centers underwent molecular screening, and 213 with <i>RAS</i> and <i>BRAF</i> wt ctDNA were randomized (arm A/B = 106/107). Median age was 61 and 64 years (A/B), most pts had left-sided primary tumors (92/88%, A/B), and had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy in both tx arms. After a median follow-up of 23.5 months (mos), 194 and 135 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> disease progression events were recorded, while OS data were not mature yet. Key efficacy outcomes are summarized in the table. Adverse events occurred with the expected frequency and grade in both treatment arms. <b>Conclusions:</b> PARERE is the largest randomized trial demonstrating an ORR and PFS advantage in favor of liquid biopsy-guided anti-EGFR re-tx, compared to regorafenib, in the late-line setting of <i>RAS</i>/<i>BRAF </i>wt mCRC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04787341"">NCT04787341</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-494204-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-494204-001""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">ARM A<sup>a</sup><br/>pani, N = 106</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">ARM B<br/>rego, N = 107</th><td data-type=""border-bottom""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom""><br/>p*</th><th data-type=""border-bottom""><br/>p**</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">1<sup>st</sup> PFS, median mos</td><td>4.1</td><td>2.4</td><td>HR: 1.23 (95% CI: 0.93 – 1.64)</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.12</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">1<sup>st</sup> ORR, %</td><td>16.0</td><td>1.9</td><td colspan=""3"">OR: 0.1 (95% CI: 0.01 – 0.44); p &lt; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">1<sup>st</sup> DCR, %</td><td>59.4</td><td>31.8</td><td colspan=""3"">OR: 0.32 (95% CI: 0.18 – 0.56); p &lt; 0.01</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> </td><th>ARM A<sup>a</sup><br/>rego, N = 75</th><th>ARM B<br/>pani, N = 70</th><td colspan=""3""><span></span></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">2<sup>nd</sup> PFS, median mos</td><td>2.7</td><td>3.7</td><td>HR: 0.76 (95%CI: 0.54 – 1.07)</td><td>0.12</td><td>0.07</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">2<sup>nd</sup> ORR, %</td><td>0</td><td>17.4</td><td colspan=""3"">OR: NA (95% CI: 3.44 - NA); p &lt; 0.01</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">2<sup>nd</sup> DCR, %</td><td>37.3</td><td>55.7</td><td colspan=""3"">OR: 2.17 (95% CI: 1.11 – 4.27); p = 0.02</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""6"" data-type=""row-heading"">Per protocol population<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">2<sup>nd</sup> PFS, median mos</td><td>2.7</td><td>3.9</td><td>HR: 0.71 (95%CI: 0.5 – 1.01)</td><td>0.06</td><td>0.03</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-494204-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">OR, Odds Ratio; CI, confidence interval; NA, not assessable; *Cox proportional hazards model; **stratified log-rank test according to ECOG PS; <sup> a</sup>reference; <sup>b</sup>pts actually treated with rego and pani (A/B, N = 68/69).</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> HER2-low expressing breast cancer represents a heterogenous subtype with limited targeted therapeutic options. Disitamab Vedotin, a novel HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), and Penpulimab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, have both demonstrated potential in various cancer treatment contexts. This study aims to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of Disitamab Vedotin in combination with Penpulimab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-low expressing, stage II-III breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> This single-center, prospective, non-randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with newly diagnosed HER2-low expressing (IHC 1+ or 2+ without amplification by FISH), stage II-III breast cancer in West China Hospital. All patients received neoadjuvant treatment with Disitamab Vedotin (2.0 mg/kg IV) and Penpulimab (200 mg IV) every 3 weeks for a total of 6 cycles, followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR), and secondary endpoints included overall response rate (ORR) and treatment-related adverse events (AEs). <b>Results:</b> From August 2023 to August 2024, a total of 20 patients were enrolled in the study, with two patients withdrawing due to intolerance to adverse reactions and two others discontinued due to disease progression. At the end of the treatment, the total pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) rate was 25.0% (4/16). The ORR reached 56.3% (9/16) by the clinical response assessment at the end of neoadjuvant treatment. The PD-L1 positive subgroup demonstrated a higher tpCR rate compared to the PD-L1 negative subgroup (33.3% vs. 14.3%). Additionally, the IHC 1+ subgroup exhibited a lower tpCR rate than the IHC 2+ subgroup without amplification by FISH (11.1% vs. 42.9%). The most common AEs were constipation (43.8%) and itching (37.5%), with one reported serious adverse event (SAE) of herpes zoster, and no significant toxicities or treatment-related deaths observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> While the clinical benefit may be somewhat limited, the combination of Disitamab Vedotin and Penpulimab as neoadjuvant treatment for HER2-low early or locally advanced breast cancer demonstrates manageable safety and potential for furtheroptimization. This warrants additional investigation to refine and optimize treatment strategies. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05726175"">NCT05726175</a>.",Breast Cancer—Local/Regional/Adjuvant,NCT05726175

<b>Background:</b> Recurrent/metastatic (R/M) salivary gland cancers (SGCs) are rare diseases without standard therapies. Based on the hypothesis that VEGFR inhibition can enhance immune checkpoint-induced responses against SGCs, we conducted a phase II trial of the multikinase inhibitor lenvatinib (len) plus the programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab (pem) in two R/M SGC cohorts: adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and non-ACC histologies. Here we report results from the completed non-ACC cohort. <b>Methods:</b> Patients (Pts) with R/M SGC (except ACC) were enrolled. RECIST v1.1 measurable disease was required; prior therapies were allowed. Pts with acinic cell carcinoma (AcCC) were required to have progression of disease (PD) or worsening disease-related symptoms. Len 20 mg oral daily and pem 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks was given. The primary endpoint was best overall response (BOR) rate using a minimax Simon two-stage design. In the first stage, &gt;1 confirmed complete and/or partial responses (CRs, PRs) was required among 18 pts to enroll 14 more pts. &gt;4 responses among 32 pts would be considered positive (BOR 5% vs 20%, 1-sided alpha 0.1, power 0.9). Secondary objectives were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety/tolerability per CTCAE v5.0. <b>Results:</b> 27 pts with R/M SGC pts were enrolled; 26 evaluable for the study endpoints. Among evaluable pts, the median age was 62 and 15 were men. SGC histologies included 9 AcCC, 8 salivary duct carcinoma (SDC), 4 myoepithelial carcinoma, 2 mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and 1 each of polymorphous adenocarcinoma, epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma, and mucinous adenocarcinoma. 5/26 (19.2%) had confirmed PR. 18 pts had stable disease (SD), 1 PD as best response; 2 evaluable pts did not reach first scan assessment. As of 1/20/25, median PFS was 47 weeks. Among the 9 AcCC pts, 4 (44.4%) had PR and 5 SD; 8/9 pts had tumor regression in target lesions. For the 8 SDC pts, 1/8 (12.5%) had PR. Per protocol, 2 pts (AcCC and SDC) stopped treatment after 2 years; both resumed treatment when PD occurred, achieving SD and PR, respectively. Six deaths were observed, 4 possibly related to treatment: 3 SDC (respiratory failure due to pneumonitis vs. cancer progression [1]; cardiac arrest after polymyositis/myocarditis/aspiration pneumonia [1]; stroke [1]) and 1 myoepithelial carcinoma (respiratory failure due to pneumonitis vs. infection [1]). <b>Conclusions:</b> Trial enrollment was completed after 26 evaluable pts given the study was positive for the primary BOR endpoint and the grade 5 events observed. Len+pembro may be active and safe among pts with AcCC, though further study is needed. This combination may be less promising for SDC given the grade 5 events and low response rate observed.

<b>Background:</b> Localized high-risk soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) presents a therapeutic challenge due to limited preoperative treatment options. Radiotherapy (RT) and Doxorubicin (DOXO) are well-established immunogenic cell death inducers [1-3], which are capable of boosting the effects of immunotherapy even in ""cold"" tumors. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a preoperative triple combination of RT, DOXO, and the PD-1 antibody for STS. <b>Methods:</b> In this Phase Ib/II trial (NCT05774275), up to 52 patients with localized high-risk STSs will be enrolled. Participants will receive RT (BED = 50-60 Gy), combined with DOXO and PD-1 antibody (Sintilimab, SIN 200 mg, Day 1) every three weeks for four cycles prior to surgery. In Phase Ib (3+3 design), patients will receive Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD, 37.5 mg/m² or 30 mg/m², i.v., Day 1) to establish the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). In Phase II, DOXO will be administered as PLD at RP2D or as Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Adriamycin, ADM, 75 mg/m² i.v., Day 1). The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR), while secondary endpoints include the rate of pathological complete response (pCR) and near pCR (defined as &lt; 10% viable tumor cells), survival and safety. <b>Results:</b> From September 2022 to January 2025, 33 patients (26 in limbs and 7 in trunks) were enrolled. The median age was 50 years (range 19-75), with 17 males, and 13 patients had prior surgeries. 29 tumors were histological grade 3. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed in the first six patients receiving PLD (37.5 mg/m², i.v., Day 1, q3w), confirming the RP2D. Among the 28 radiological evaluable patients, 2 achieved complete response (CR), 12 achieved partial response (PR), and 11 had stable disease, resulting in an ORR of 50.0% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 89.2%. In addition, among 24 pathological assessable patients, 14 (58.3%) achieved pCR or near-pCR. Two patients (9.5%) experienced major wound complications. They underwent secondary operation and readmission to hospital for wound care, respectively. Other serious adverse events (SAE) include Grade 3 dermatitis (17.9%) and Grade 3-4 neutropenia (7.1%). No G5 SAE were reported. Median progression-free survival and overall survival have not yet been reached. <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of RT, DOXO, and SIN showed potential efficacy and tolerable toxicity in high-risk localized limbs and trunk STS.

<b>Background:</b> Less than 20% of hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer (HRBC) patients (pts) achieve pathologic complete response with current chemotherapy-based neoadjuvant treatment (NAT). There is a need to evaluate novel non-chemotherapy NAT regimens for HRBC. Abemaciclib is a cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor approved for the treatment of high-risk early stage and metastatic HRBC. Niraparib is a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) approved for the treatment of ovarian cancers. In preclinical data, treatment with abemaciclib sensitizes tumors to DNA damaging agents such as PARPi. This is a phase 1 study evaluating the combination of abemaciclib and niraparib as NAT for HRBC (NCT04481113). <b>Methods:</b> Pts aged ≥18 years with biopsy-proven stage I-III HRBC (ER ≥1%, PR ≥1%, HER2 non-amplified) planned for NAT were eligible for this study. Pts were treated according to a traditional 3+3 dose-escalation algorithm, with the starting dose level 1 (DL1) consisting of abemaciclib 150 mg PO BID and niraparib 100 mg PO daily, and DL2 of abemaciclib 150 mg PO BID and niraparib 200 mg PO daily. After 2 cycles, pts underwent repeat imaging and biopsy. Pts with response or stable disease (SD) received an additional 2 cycles of treatment, while pts with progressive disease (PD) were switched to standard of care chemotherapy. The primary endpoints were to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). <b>Results:</b> A total of 8 pts were enrolled. Median age was 56 years, 6<i> </i>were postmenopausal and 2 premenopausal. No pts had germline <i>BRCA</i> mutations. No DLTs occurred among 3 pts treated at DL1; however, 2 DLTs occurred at DL2, including one hematological DLT (dose delay &gt;7 days due to myelosuppression) and a grade 5 cardiac adverse event (AE). Most AEs were grade 1-2, with the most common being gastrointestinal toxicities. The study was subsequently closed to accrual. The MTD was determined to be abemaciclib 150 mg PO BID and niraparib 100 mg PO daily. Among 5 pts who completed 2 cycles of abemaciclib and niraparib followed by disease evaluation, 2 achieved a partial response and 3 had SD by modified RECIST. There was no PD noted on study therapy. No locoregional or distant recurrences were noted at 3-year follow up. Serial biopsies on trial demonstrated tumor heterogeneity, and 2 pts with HER2-amplified disease on repeat biopsy were appropriately switched to NAT with HER2-based chemotherapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> This phase 1 study established abemaciclib 150 mg PO BID and niraparib 100 mg PO daily as the recommended phase 2 dose for this combination.

<b>Background:</b> Radical surgical resection represents the only potentially curative treatment option for Biliary Tract Cancer (BTC) and (incidental) Gallbladder Carcinoma ((I)GBC). Nevertheless, 5-year OS is only 20–40% after curatively intended resection and data regarding pure adjuvant chemotherapy in BTCs are currently conflicting. Encouraging results of neoadjuvant/perioperative concepts in other malignancies provide a rationale to use this treatment in the early phase management of GBC and intrahepatic as well extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC/ECC). <b>Methods:</b> GAIN is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label phase III trial, including patients (pts) with localized or locally advanced resectable non metastatic biliary tract cancer (intra-/extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ICC/ECC; GBC in front of radical liver resection). Pts were randomized to either neoadjuvant (perioperative) systemic chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Cisplatin 3 cycles pre- and post-surgery) followed by radical surgery (Arm A) or to direct surgery followed by adjuvant treatment (Arm B) according to investigators choice. Primary endpoint was OS; secondary endpoints were PFS/EFS, R0-resection rate, toxicity, perioperative morbidity, mortality and QoL. Recruitment was stopped after enrollment of 68 pts due to a slow enrollment rate. <b>Results:</b> Between Dec 2019 and Feb 2024, 68 pts were randomized and the ITT comprised 32 pts in Arm A and 30 pts in Arm B. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms (overall, male 55%; median age 66.0; cT3/T4 29.0%; cN+ 30.6%; 37.1% ICC, 30.6% ECC and 32.3% GBC). 90.6% of pts in Arm A completed all 3 pre-operative cycles. 43.8% in Arm A completed adjuvant treatment and 23.3% in Arm B received adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up was 11.8 months. Neoadjuvant treatment improved OS (mOS, Arm A 27.8 vs. 14.6 months Arm B; HR 0.46 [0.22 - 0.96]; p = 0.04) and R0 resection rate (62.5% vs 33.3%). This effect was also seen in event-free survival. Postoperative morbidity rates were similar in both arms (33.3% (A) vs. 32% (B)) and the 30- and 90-days mortality rates were lower for Arm A (30-days: 4.2% vs. 24%; 90-days: 4.2% vs. 28%). No new safety/toxicity signals were observed. In Arm A, 12 pts (38.7%) had at least one treatment related adverse event (TRAE) with grade 3 and 1 pt (3.2%) with grade 4. No fatal TRAEs were observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> Neoadjuvant / perioperative gem/cis clearly improved OS and R0 resection rate in pts with biliary tract cancer compared to direct surgery and was able to nearly double mOS while not increasing the morbidity rate and even decreasing mortality rates. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03673072"">NCT03673072</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",NCT03673072

<b>Background:</b> Our previous study demonstrated that double-negative T cells (DNTs) hold potential for treating relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). In a first-in-human Phase I trial (ChiCTR-IPR-1900022795), we reported a complete response (CR) rate of 50% (5/10) with a favorable safety profile. This Phase I/II study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of off-the-shelf allo-DNTs in preventing relapse in AML patients following allo-HSCT. <b>Methods:</b> Six high-risk AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled and assigned to two dosage groups: 1×10^8 DNTs/kg and 1.5×10^8 DNTs/kg. Each patient received three infusions at one-month intervals without prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The median time from transplantation to the first infusion was 3.1 months. Primary endpoint was the occurrence of adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities, while the secondary endpoint was cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). GMP-grade DNTs were expanded ex vivo from healthy donor PBMCs and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until infusion. <b>Results:</b> As of January 20, 2025, with a median follow-up of 17.55 months post-HSCT, four of six patients (66.7%) remained in MRD-negative CR, with the longest recurrence-free survival exceeding 17 months. The two relapsed patients both carried high-risk genetic mutations (TP53 mutation) and were MRD-positive prior to transplantation. They succumbed at 11.4 and 14.2 months post-HSCT respectively. Donor-derived DNTs were detectable in peripheral blood shortly after each infusion, peaking at 1–4 days and persisting for up to 28 days. In two patients with MRD-negative CR, infused DNTs remained detectable for up to 360 days post-infusion. Elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-10 post-infusion indicated immune activation. Importantly, no dose-limiting toxicities, neurotoxicity, cytokine release syndrome greater than Grade 2, or graft-versus-host disease were observed. In contrast to the two relapsed patients, MRD-negative CR patients showed expanded levels of CD4+, CD8+, and DNT cells, particularly those with the effector memory T cell phenotype. Both the infused DNTs and the recipient's CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in these patients secreted higher levels of granzymes A and K. To investigate the interaction between CD8+ T cells and allo-DNTs in MRD-negative CR patients, co-culture experiments were conducted. CD8+ T cells exhibited an increase in the secretion of granzyme B and IFN-γ within 3–4 days. Transcriptome sequencing and multi-cytokine analyses revealed strong immune activation. <b>Conclusions:</b> The dual ability of DNTs to suppress GvHD while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect, along with its potential for off-the-shelf availability, makes it a transformative therapy in the post-transplant setting. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05858814"">NCT05858814</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05858814

<b>Background:</b> Metabolism of Venetoclax(VEN) by CYP3A enzymes gives a unique opportunity to administer it at a lower dose with a CYP3A inhibitor. Azoles are strong CYP3A inhibitors &amp; they are commonly used for antifungal prophylaxis during AML induction. Current data suggest that VEN 100mg with posaconazole achieves comparable clinical efficacy but is associated with higher myelotoxicity. We prospectively explored further dose reduction of VEN to 50 mg with posaconazole &amp; compared it with VEN 400 mg with respect to pharmacokinetics, response rates &amp; toxicity. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an open-label, prospective study &amp; enrolled 31 AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Patients received either VEN 50 mg with posaconazole (VEN50 cohort, n=20) or VEN 400 mg without posaconazole (VEN400 cohort, n=11). Pharmacokinetic parameters, including C0, Cmax, &amp; AUC(0–24), were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Clinical outcomes: overall response rate (ORR), composite complete response (CRc), measurable residual disease (MRD), &amp; hematological recovery time-were analysed. <b>Results:</b> The median age of patients was 50 years (IQR: 35.5–60). Under the ELN2024 model, 74% of VEN50 patients &amp; 63.6% of VEN400 patients were favourable-risk, while 26% &amp; 36.4% were intermediate-risk, respectively. The ORR was 80% in the VEN50 cohort &amp; 81.8% in the VEN400 cohort. CRc rates were comparable between the VEN50 (60%) &amp; VEN400 (63.6%) cohorts, with similar MRD negativity rates (30% vs. 36.3%). Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed significantly lower systemic drug exposure in the VEN50 cohort [AUC(0–24):17.88 µg·h/mL vs. 48.05 µg·h/mL, p=0.002] with C0 levels of 0.42 µg/mL vs. 1.08 µg/mL (p=0.004) &amp; Cmax levels of 1.435 µg/mL vs. 3.63 µg/mL (p=0.002). Patients in VEN50 cohort experienced shorter neutropenic phase (17.5 vs. 24 days). Adverse events, including febrile neutropenia (60% vs. 72.7%, p=0.501) &amp; culture-positive infections (20% vs. 27.2%, p=0.569), were comparable between the two cohorts. No treatment-related death occurred in either of the group. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest that lower plasma levels achieved with VEN50 can lead to comparable CR rate &amp; MRD negative rate in comparison with VEN400 with lesser myelotoxicity.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-493462-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-493462-001""><figcaption>Comparison of baseline characteristics and outcomes.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Category</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">VEN 50mg + Posaconazole)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">VEN 400 mg</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">P-Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Median Age (IQR)</td><td>50 (35–59)</td><td>39 (35–52)</td><td>0.32</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ECOG (0–2) (%)</td><td>90</td><td>91</td><td>0.29</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">C0 (µg/mL, Median)</td><td>0.42 (0.17–1.57)</td><td>1.08 (0.4–2.78)</td><td>0.004</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Cmax (µg/mL, Median)</td><td>1.435 (0.54–5.51)</td><td>3.63 (1.27–6.92)</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">AUC0-24 (µg·h/mL, Median)</td><td>17.88 (8.09–81.47)</td><td>48.05 (19.96–94.79)</td><td>0.002</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Overall Response Rate (ORR) (%)</td><td>80</td><td>81.8</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">CRc (CR + CRi) (%)</td><td>60</td><td>63.6</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">MRD Negativity (%)</td><td>30</td><td>36.3</td><td>0.98</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Febrile Neutropenia (%)</td><td>60</td><td>72.7</td><td>0.501</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Neutropenia Recovery (days, Median)</td><td>17.5</td><td>24</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Culture-Positive Infections (%)</td><td>20</td><td>27.2</td><td>0.569</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-493462-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> The optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy for pneumonitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors is clinically relevant. Several guidelines recommend a duration of 4 to 6 weeks for mild immune-related pneumonitis. However, evidence from clinical trials is limited. We conducted the first randomized trial to evaluate whether short-term corticosteroid therapy can achieve comparable efficacy. <b>Methods:</b> In this multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial at 22 institutions in Japan, we randomly assigned patients with mild immune-related pneumonitis according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 1 or 2, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either 3-week or 6-week corticosteroid treatment. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment success 8 weeks after the start of steroid administration, with a non-inferiority margin of 16 percentage points. The major secondary endpoints were safety, percentage of participants with treatment failure, quality of life, and overall survival. The primary hypothesis was that a 3-week treatment would be non-inferior to a 6-week treatment in terms of the primary endpoint. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 106 patients were randomized, and after the exclusion of one patient without immune-related pneumonitis, 105 were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population: 51 patients in the 3-week group and 54 in the 6-week group. In the ITT population, the patients’ median age was 72 years; 81% of the patients were men, and 73% had grade 2 at baseline. The rate of treatment success was 66.7% in the 3-week group and 85.2% in the 6-week group, which did not demonstrate noninferiority in the overall study population (difference, −18.5% percentage points [80% confidence interval {CI}, −29.0% to -7.9%], p = 0.621), and a predefined exploratory superiority analysis indicated superiority of the 6-week regimen (p = 0.013). Over the entire study period, the relapse or exacerbation rates of pneumonitis were 41.1% in the 3-week group and 24.1% in the 6-week group. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 12% of patients in the 3-week group and 24% of patients in the 6-week group. The absolute mean change in the total QOL using the K-BILD score from baseline was 4.78 in the 3-week group and 6.28 in the 6-week group (between-group difference, -1.50 points; 95% CI, −5.91 to 2.91). <b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with mild immune-related pneumonitis, non-inferiority of 3-week corticosteroid treatment compared to that of 6 weeks was not confirmed in the overall population, and the relapse or exacerbation rate of pneumonitis was higher in the 3-week group over the entire study period.

<b>Background:</b> LB1410 is a recombinant humanized anti-PD-1/TIM-3 bispecific antibody (BsAb) developed by L&amp;L Biopharma Co., Ltd. for patients (pts) resistant to or refractory to PD-1/PD-L1 treatments, showing superior T/DC cell activity and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy compared to a combination of TIM-3 and PD-1 antibodies in preclinical studies. Here, we report the dose escalation and dose expansion results of LB1410 as monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors (Keyplus-001). <b>Methods:</b> Eligible patients were ≥18 years old with ECOG PS 0-1 and advanced solid tumors. Dose cohorts ranged from 0.001 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg IV Q2W: 0.001 mg/kg-1 mg/kg in an accelerated titration design, and 3 mg/kg - 20 mg/kg using a traditional 3+3 design. Selected dose levels were expanded in patients with advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and cervical cancer (CC). The primary objective was safety, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Secondary/exploratory objectives included efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity. <b>Results:</b> As of January 15, 2025, a total of 79 patients received LB1410 at doses ranging from 0.001 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg as of January 15, 2025. The median age was 59 years, and 70% of patients were male. All enrolled patients had multiple organ metastases or multiple metastases in a single organ and were heavily pretreated with anti-tumor therapies. Of the patients, 76.9% (60/79) had solid tumors that had failed standard therapies and were resistant or refractory to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 63.3% of patients. The most common TRAEs (≥10%) included anemia (24.1%), proteinuria (12.7%), increased alanine aminotransferase (11.4%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (11.4%), hyponatremia (10.1%), increased blood lactate dehydrogenase (10.1%), and weight loss (10.2%). Grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 7 patients, including 3 with hypokalemia, 2 with hypertension, 1 with hyponatremia, 1 with proteinuria, and 1 with pulmonary embolism. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. On- treatment scan was available for 66 patients. The observed overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 was 3/66 (4.5%), with 3 confirmed partial responses (PRs) in patients with ccRCC and CC. The disease control rate (DCR) was 45.5% (30/66). In patients with ccRCC, the ORR was 16.7% (1/6), and the DCR was 66.7% (4/6). In patients with CC, the ORR and DCR were both 66.7% (2/3). Of the 27 patients with stable disease, 3 had stable disease for nearly 12 months, and 2 of them are still receiving ongoing treatment in the study. <b>Conclusions:</b> LB1410 has a manageable safety profile and demonstrates potential efficacy at tolerable doses in heavily pretreated patients, particularly those with immune-oncology (IO)-refractory or resistant ccRCC and CC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05357651"">NCT05357651</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05357651

<b>Background:</b> Clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) is a chemoresistant subtype of ovarian cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been reported to have clinical activity in CCOC. Additionally, CCOC harbors molecular alterations suggesting a role for anti-angiogenic agents. We therefore conducted a single-arm two-stage phase 2 trial to investigate the clinical activity of the combination of the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab with the anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib in patients (pts) with CCOC. <b>Methods:</b> Pts with CCOC and measurable disease received pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks and lenvatinib 20 mg daily. Pts could have received an unlimited number of prior therapies; prior bevacizumab and immune checkpoint inhibitors were allowed, but prior lenvatinib was exclusionary. Malignant bowel involvement was not allowed. Co-primary endpoints were objective response rate (H<sub>0</sub> 5%; H<sub>a</sub> 25%) and rate of PFS at 6 months (mo) per RECIST v1.1 (H<sub>0</sub> 10%; H<sub>a</sub> 30%), restricting the probabilities of type I and type II errors to 10% and 10%, respectively. Two pts with objective responses or 3 pts progression-free and alive at 6 mos were needed to proceed from stage 1 (n=18) to stage 2 (n=13); 5 pts with objective responses or 6 pts progression-free and alive at 6 mos were needed to declare the combination worthy of further study. <b>Results:</b> Data cut-off occurred 22-Oct-2024. Of 30 enrolled pts, 83.3% were white; the mean age among all pts was 54.1 years. 30% of pts (9/30) experienced a confirmed response (2 CR, 7 PR); an additional 3 pts (10%) experienced unconfirmed PRs and 4 pts (13.3%) had SD ≥6 mo. As of data cut-off, 3 pts (10%) had not yet reached their first radiographic assessments, and 17 pts were still receiving study therapy. With a median of 9.72 mo of follow up, 16 pts were alive and progression-free at 6 months. The estimated 6-month PFS was 75.96% (95% CI 53.82-88.51%). Median PFS was 10.9 mo. The estimated 12-month PFS was 48.86% (95% CI 23.67-70.04%). The most common any-grade TRAEs were hypertension (71%), hypothyroidism (66%), and fatigue (60%). There were no unanticipated TRAEs. <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib demonstrates encouraging evidence of clinical activity in CCOC, with 9 pts experiencing a confirmed response and 16 pts alive and progression-free at 6 months. As both co-primary endpoints of the study were met, enrollment closed with 30 pts. Updated data for all pts will be reported. There were no new safety signals. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05296512"">NCT05296512</a>.",Gynecologic Cancer,NCT05296512

<b>Background:</b> EVEREST-2 is a first-in-human, phase 1/2 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of A2B694, an autologous, logic-gated Tmod CAR T therapy targeted to MSLN, which is normally expressed in the mesothelium and can be upregulated in many solid tumors. A2B694 is designed to overcome challenges of on-target, off-tumor toxicity that have limited other MSLN-targeted approaches by combining a CAR-activating receptor targeting MSLN with a blocker CAR that recognizes HLA-A*02, to distinguish between normal and tumor cells (Tokatlian, et al. <i>J Immunother Cancer.</i> 2022). <b>Methods:</b> Adults with recurrent unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic cancers with MSLN expression who have progressed after standard-of-care therapy are eligible for EVEREST-2. Enrollment to EVEREST-2 and collection of T-cells occurs through the ongoing prescreening study BASECAMP-1 (NCT04981119). When clinically appropriate, A2B694 is manufactured from cryopreserved T cells, and patients undergo lymphodepletion before A2B694 infusion. The dose-escalation phase is evaluating the safety and tolerability of A2B694 to identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Dose escalation was started at 1x10<sup>8</sup> Tmod positive cells (dose level [DL] 1) and will increase up to 14x10<sup>8</sup> in combination with low-dose IL-2 (DL 5). The dose-expansion phase will confirm RP2D and collect biomarker data to further characterize A2B694. <b>Results:</b> As of January 15, 2025, 5 participants (median age: 60 years; range, 50-84) have enrolled on EVEREST-2 and received A2B694 at DLs 1-2; participants had ovarian cancer (n = 3), pancreatic cancer (n = 1), and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 1) and had received a median of 4 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-7). Lymphodepleting chemotherapy was well tolerated with no significant cytopenias observed. The most common adverse events were lymphopenia (7 [14.6%]) and decreased appetite (6 [12.5%]). There were no dose-limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome, nor related neurotoxicity. One participant was admitted to the hospital for decreased appetite. No long-term toxicities have been noted up to 7.5 months post-infusion. Of the participants who have received A2B694, 5 were efficacy evaluable at DLs 1-2. A2B694 was detected post-infusion in the peripheral blood in all patients. Additionally, A2B694 was detected in an abdominal tumor biopsy from a patient with pancreatic cancer 42 days post-infusion. <b>Conclusions:</b> The logic-gated approach was successful at reducing toxicity seen with prior MSLN-targeted CAR T therapies, and A2B694 showed successful CAR T expansion and tumor infiltration. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached, and results from the dose-escalation phase continue to determine the RP2D. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06051695"">NCT06051695</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Molecularly Targeted Agents and Tumor Biology,NCT06051695

<b>Background:</b> Acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), characterized by CD19 expression, responds well to CD19-targeted CAR-T therapy. However, autologous CAR-T is limited by cost and accessibility. We've developed RD06-03, an allogeneic CAR-T product engineered with TCR/Gene-X knockout and NK inhibitory molecule overexpression, exhibiting resistance to allogeneic rejection and enhanced anti-tumor effects without inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Our phase 1 trial (NCT06307600) aims to assess the safety and efficacy of RD06-03 in R/R B-ALL patients, offering a novel ""off-the-shelf"" solution. <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged 3-70 years with CD19+ R/R B-ALL were eligible and enrolled in a dose escalation study with dosing groups (CAR+ T cells/kg) of DL1: 1×10^5, DL2: 3×10^5, DL3: 5×10^5 and EDL (exploratory dose level): 6.5×10^5. All patients received lymphodepletion with fludarabine (30mg/m^2/day) and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m^2/day) for 3 days before CAR-T infusion. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) were evaluated using accelerated titration and ""3+3"" escalation, followed by case expansion at the appropriate dose. <b>Results:</b> As of December 15, 2024, six R/R B-ALL patients were enrolled (DL1: 1, DL2: 3, DL3: 1 and EDL: 1) with a median age of 37.5 years (range, 18-63) and a median of 3 prior therapies (range, 2-8+). One patient relapsed after unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Baseline median bone marrow blasts were 41.9% (range, 10%-88.5%). RD06-03 was well tolerated with no DLT, neurotoxicity or GvHD observed. CRS occurred in 4 of 6 patients (66.7%, all Grade 1) with a median duration of 2.5 days (range, 1-4). For doses above DL2, all 5 patients achieved CR/CRi (100%) with undetectable MRD, indicating a deep remission. The majority of responders remain in remission, with the longest remission duration reaching 147 days and a median follow-up of 128 days (range, 60-175). Robust expansion was observed in all patients receiving doses above DL2, with rapid expansion occurring at a median of 4 days post-infusion. The median peak expansion exceeded 1 million copies/μg DNA, with a median persistence of 28 days and the longest persistence surpassing 3 months. <b>Conclusions:</b> The phase I trial of RD06-03 confirms its safety and efficacy in patients with R/R B-ALL. Notably, RD06-03's engineered TCR/Gene-X and NK inhibitory molecules enhance its resistance to rejection and antileukemic activity without GvHD. RD06-03 demonstrates robust persistence, achieving a 100% CR/CRi rate in medium- to high-dose groups, which is even lower than that of autologous CAR-T, while maintaining a manageable safety profile under standard lymphodepletion. This aligns with its genetic modifications designed for optimal immune rejection resistance. Further studies are essential to solidify these findings and explore RD06-03's therapeutic potential. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06307600"">NCT06307600</a>.","Hematologic Malignancies—Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, and Allotransplant",NCT06307600

<b>Background:</b> NIRA is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1/2. In the MAGNITUDE trial, NIRA + AAP significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in HRR gene–altered metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled AMPLITUDE trial (NCT04497844) evaluated the efficacy and safety of NIRA + AAP in HRR gene–altered mCSPC. <b>Methods:</b> Pts with germline or somatic HRR gene alterations (<i>BRCA1</i>, <i>BRCA2</i>, <i>BRIP1</i>, <i>CDK12</i>, <i>CHEK2</i>, <i>FANCA</i>, <i>PALB2</i>,<i> RAD51B</i>,<i> RAD54L</i>) were randomized 1:1 to a dual-action tablet (NIRA 200 mg + abiraterone acetate 1000 mg) plus prednisone 5 mg, or PBO + AAP (hereafter AAP). Eligible pts had received ≤6 mo of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ± ≤6 cycles of docetaxel (DOC) ± ≤45 d of AAP with metastatic disease extended beyond lymph nodes. The primary end point is investigator-assessed rPFS (time from randomization to radiographic progression or death). Secondary end points include time to symptomatic progression (TSP), overall survival (OS), and safety. The Kaplan-Meier product limit method and a stratified Cox model were used for time-to-event variables and the hazard ratio (HR) and stratified log-rank test for estimating treatment effect. This is the first and final analysis for rPFS and the first interim analysis (of 3) for OS (data cutoff, 7 Jan 2025). Approximately 261 rPFS events were required (2-sided α, 0.025; power, 91%) for an HR ≤0.64 to demonstrate efficacy. <b>Results:</b> 696 pts were randomized to NIRA + AAP (n=348) or AAP (n=348). Median age was 68 y (IQR, 61-74); 55.6% had <i>BRCA1/2</i> alterations, 78% were high-volume metastatic (M1), 87% were de novo M1, and 16% had prior DOC. Median follow-up is 30.8 mo. The primary end point was met, with rPFS significantly longer with NIRA + AAP (median, not reached [NR]) vs AAP (29.5 mo [95% CI, 25.8-NR]; HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49-0.80], p=0.0001), including in the prespecified <i>BRCA1/2</i> subgroup (HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.37-0.72], p&lt;0.0001). TSP was significantly improved with NIRA + AAP vs AAP (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36-0.69], p&lt;0.0001; <i>BRCA1/2</i>: HR, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.29-0.68], p=0.0001). A trend in OS was seen at this first interim analysis (193/389 events) favoring NIRA + AAP (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.59-1.04], p=0.10; <i>BRCA1/2</i>: HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.51-1.11], p=0.15). Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 75.2% with NIRA + AAP and 58.9% with AAP, most commonly anemia (29.1% vs 4.6%) and hypertension (26.5% vs 18.4%). Treatment discontinuations due to AEs were low: NIRA + AAP: 11.0%; AAP: 6.9%. <b>Conclusions:</b> NIRA + AAP significantly improved rPFS and TSP vs AAP in pts receiving ADT +/- prior DOC and had a favorable effect on OS. There were no new safety signals. AMPLITUDE supports NIRA + AAP as a potential new standard of care for pts with HRR gene–altered mCSPC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04497844"">NCT04497844</a>.","Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile",NCT04497844

<b>Background:</b> Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with high incidence are significant challenges, as they often lead to the interruption or discontinuation of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. There is an urgent need for adjuvant therapies to mitigate irAEs. Here, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gegen Qinlian Tablets(GQT) in attenuating irAEs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICIs. <b>Methods:</b> In this randomized, multicenter, open-label trial, eligible patients with NSCLC at the first-line therapy were randomly (1:1) divided into two groups to receive ICI and chemotherapy (control group, n = 47) or to receive ICI and chemotherapy plus Gegen Qinlian Tablets (GQT group, n = 47). The primary endpoint was the incidence and severity of irAEs. The secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Exploratory indicators were the analysis results of 16s rRNA and metabolomics detection of fecal samples from GQT and control groups before initial treatment (T-P group, C-P group) and after 3 cycles of treatment (T-A group, C-A group). This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR2200062607). <b>Results:</b> A total of 94 patients were enrolled from October, 2022 to July, 2024. The incidence of irAEs was 31.91% (15/47) in the GQT group and 59.57% (28/47) in the control group. The incidence of irAEs in the GQT group was decreased significantly (P = 0.007). No patient occurred multisystemic toxicity in the GQT group and 3 patients in the control group(3/28, 10.7%). The median onset time of irAEs in the GQT group was 14.9 weeks, and in the control group was 8.7 weeks (P = 0.807). The ORR was 48.9% (0 CR, 48.9% PR) among response-evaluable patients in the GQT group (n = 45), while it was 36.2% (2.1% CR, 34.0% PR) in the control group (n = 43) (<i><i>P</i></i> = 0.211). 5 patients (10.6%) experienced constipation after receiving GQT. No other adverse reactions were attributed to GQT. The results of 16s rRNA and metabolomics detection of fecal samples showed significant differences in the gut microbiota composition between the T-P and T-A groups (P = 0.019). Compared to C-A patients, <i><i>Subdoligranulum</i></i> and <i><i>Atopobiaceae</i></i> were increased in T-A patients, while <i><i>Holdemanella</i></i>, <i><i>Atopobium</i></i>, and <i><i>Escherichia_Shigella</i></i> were significantly reduced. Furthermore, prostaglandin A1 was higher, while glyceric acid and deoxyadenosine were lower in the T-A compared with the C-A. And these metabolisms were found to be significantly enriched in glycerolipid metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our current findings indicated that GQT might attenuate irAEs significantly and prolong the median onset time of irAEs by regulating the gut microflora and metabolites.

<b>Background:</b> Carboplatin-based regimen are effective in patients (pts) with eTNBC, and olaparib improves the outcome of pts with <i>BRCA1/2</i> pathogenic variants (PV), but the safety / efficacy of OC co-treatment in HRD-positive TNBC is unknown. ABCSG 45 (EU CT 2024-512821-10) is a prospective multicenter phase II study investigating the efficacy and tolerability of OC compared to conventional chemotherapy in HRD-positive eTNBC. <b>Methods:</b> Pts with HRD (Myriad genetics)-positive eTNBC were randomized to 6 cycles of olaparib (100 mg bid, days 4-16) / carboplatin (AUC 5) q3w, or 6 cycles of docetaxel/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (75/50/500) q3w (TAC). In an initial dose-finding phase, 100 mg bid was identified as olaparib combination dose. Stratification factors were tumoral <i>BRCA1/2</i> and menopausal status. Primary endpoint was centrally assessed residual cancer burden (RCB), pCR and QoL were secondary endpoints. Planned sample size was 90 pts, randomized 1:1 to achieve 80% power (two-sided alpha=0.05) to detect a RCB 0/I difference of 31%. Differences between treatment arms were assessed with a two-sided Cochran Mantel-Haenszel test using stratification factors. Pre-defined subgroup analysis was performed with logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> A total of 90 pts (OC: n=46; TAC: n=44), of whom 42 (47%) were <i>BRCA1/2</i> PV carriers, were randomized between November 2019 and December 2023. Median age was 50.5 years (range 27.0-80.0). 40% had cT1, 55.6% cT2, and 4.4% cT3/4 tumors, and 60% of pts were clinically N0. 94.4% of tumors were G3, and Ki67 was &gt;60% in 71.1%. Overall, the RCB0/I rate with OC was 52.2% vs. 70.5% with TAC (stratified risk difference = -18.8% (95%CI: -39.6% to 2.0%); p=0.068). In pts with <i>BRCA1/2</i> PV, RCB0/I rates were comparable: 77.3% (OC) vs. 65.0% (TAC), while in 47 pts with <i>BRCA1/2</i> wild type (WT), OC was significantly less effective: RCB0/I of 29.2% vs 73.9% in TAC (interaction p=0.008). pCR was achieved in 47.8% (OC) vs 59.1% (TAC; p=0.231). In pts with a <i>BRCA1/2</i> PV, OC resulted in 77.3% pCR rate, vs. TAC 65.0%, in <i>BRCA1/2 WT</i> pts pCR was achieved by 20.8% (OC) vs. 56.5% (TAC) (interaction p=0.021). OC treatment resulted in more ≥ grade 3 hematologic toxicities with 30% vs 3% thrombocytopenia and 43% vs 18% neutropenia but caused fewer non-hematological toxicities. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this prospective randomized study in HRD-positive TNBC, 6 cycles of TAC resulted in strikingly high RCB0/I and pCR rates, independent of <i>BRCA1/2</i> status. 6 cycles of OC achieved a pCR rate of &gt;77% in BRCA1/2 PV but were less effective in pts with <i>BRCA1/2</i> WT disease. These results may help to optimize neoadjuvant treatment strategies in TNBC.

<b>Background:</b> Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (PC) have a poor prognosis, as this 'cold' tumor shows limited responsiveness to mono-immunotherapy. Chemotherapy may improve the efficacy of immunotherapy by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. We conducted a phase II trial to assess the anti-tumor activity and safety of first-line serplulimab (anti-PD-1) and HLX04 (a bevacizumab biosimilar) combined with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (nab-P/Gem), followed by modified FOLFOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil; mFOLFOX), in patients with locally advanced or metastatic PC. <b>Methods:</b> This single-arm phase II trial enrolled 37 patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (NCT06393166). The study aims to increase the objective response rate (ORR) of the first-line sequential nab-P/Gem followed by mFOLFOX (nab-P/Gem-mFOLFOX) regimen from 50% to 68% with the addition of serplulimab and HLX04. The study employed Simon's minimax two-stage design, with a total of 23 patients achieving objective responses, thereby meeting the predefined primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. <b>Results:</b> Among the 37 patients analyzed, the average age was 62 years, and 22 patients (59.5%) were male. At baseline, patients had an adequate nutritional and performance status, with a mean BMI of 21.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Distant organ metastases were present in 34 patients (91.9%), with the liver being the most common site (n = 26, 70.3%). The confirmed ORR was 67.6% (95% CI, 49.5-82.6), including 1 patient with a complete response (CR), meeting the primary endpoint. Only 1 patient had progressive disease (PD) as the best response, yielding a DCR of 97.1% (95% CI, 84.7-99.9). As of the data cutoff in November 2024, the median follow-up was 6.1 months. The median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI, 9.7-not reached), with a 6-month PFS rate of 80.0% (95% CI, 65.5-97.7). The median time to response (TTR) was 1.5 months, and the median duration of response (DOR) was 9.3 months. The OS remains immature. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was 83.8%, with grade ≥3 TRAEs occurring in 46.0% of patients. Hematologic toxicities were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and no fatal AE were observed. Overall, the treatment was manageable, and no new safety signals were identified. <b>Conclusions:</b> First-line serplulimab and HLX04 combined with nab-P/Gem-mFOLFOX demonstrates clinical feasibility and promising preliminary outcomes in advanced PC. Further follow-up is required to confirm the survival benefits, and following analyses are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of this novel regimen. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06393166"">NCT06393166</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",NCT06393166

<b>Background:</b> Combination immune checkpoint inhibitor regimens, especially those utilizing anti-CTLA-4 blockade, demonstrate higher response rates compared with single agent anti-PD-1 therapy but also increased rates of immune related adverse events (irAEs). IL-6, a key cytokine in driving inflammatory and autoimmune responses, is a compelling target to reduce irAEs through the use of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) inhibitors. We conducted a clinical trial of 1L Nivo, Rela, and Ipi combined with the IL-6R inhibitor Sari in patients with advanced melanoma. <b>Methods:</b> 33 patients with advanced stage III/IV melanoma were treated in a single arm phase II trial. Patients received Nivo/Rela 480 mg/160 mg Q4W, Ipi 1 mg/kg Q8W and Sari 200mg q2 weeks for 12 doses over 24 weeks followed by maintenance Nivo/Rela 480 mg/160 mg Q4W and Ipi 1 mg/kg Q8W. Prior adjuvant immunotherapy was allowed if &gt; 6 months before enrollment. Patients with controlled brain metastases could enroll. The co-primary endpoints were rate of grade (gr) 3-5 irAEs and antitumor activity defined by RECIST best overall response rate at 24 weeks. With 33 patients, a difference of ≥ 22% from the known irAE rate of Nivo, Rela, and Ipi could be detected using a binomial test (2-sided alpha = 0.05, 80% power). BORR was estimated with an exact 95% Clopper Pearson confidence interval. Circulating IL-6 signaling mediators were measured over time in 14 patients using Luminex assays. <b>Results:</b> 33 patients (40% F, 60% M, PS 0-1, median age 63) were treated. Median follow-up was 9.8 months (95% CI: 8.5, 12.6 months; data lock, 12/12/24). 3% had acral and 9% mucosal melanoma. 24% had &gt; M1c disease and 39% elevated LDH. BRAF status, known for 81% of patients, was positive in 26%. BORR at 24 weeks was 63.6% (95% CI: 45.1%, 79.6%). Median PFS and OS were not reached (25<sup>th</sup> percentile for PFS = 8.3 (95% CI: 2.77, NA) months). Median treatment duration was 28 weeks and 9% discontinued therapy for toxicity. At 24 weeks 12.1% (n = 4) experienced &gt; gr 3/4 irAEs, significantly lower than the expected known irAE rate (2-sided p = 0.0007, 95% CI: 12.1%-28.2%). 27% (n = 9) had gr 3/4 toxicity over study duration; 93.9% (n = 31) had any grade irAE. Circulating IL-6Ra and IL-4 were significantly reduced at Cycle 2 (P &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Nivo, Rela, Ipi, + Sari demonstrated encouraging efficacy and tolerability. At 24 weeks, 63.6% BORR and 12.1% gr 3/4 irAE rate were observed. 2 patients had gr 4 toxicity; no gr 5 events were reported. These results compare favorably with published combination regimens including CTLA-4 blockade. Decreases in lL-6Ra and the inflammatory marker IL-4 observed post-treatment will be evaluted in a larger cohort of samples. An ongoing randomized cohort of Nivo + Rela + Ipi +/- Sari will further define the impact of IL-6R blockade on clinical outcomes in metastatic melanoma. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05428007"">NCT05428007</a>.",Melanoma/Skin Cancers,NCT05428007

<b>Background:</b> Sonidegib is an efficacious treatment of LA laBCC but is associated with a high risk of treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) causing treatment discontinuation. Following a CR, treatment discontinuation rate reaches up to 60% after a year, leading to 3 years relapse free survival rate of 35%. We aimed at evaluating sonidegib tailored schedule (TS) after CR to increase treatment duration by reducing TRAEs, thus allowing CR maintenance. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a multicenter, open-label, single-arm phase II study enrolling adult patients (pts) with laBCC who obtained a CR to sonidegib regardless of the tumor’s subtype and burden. Eligible pts received TS1 with sonidegib 14 days on and 14 days off. Pts on TS1 who experienced grade 2-3 toxicity (except alopecia) lasting &gt;28 days moved to TS2 (7 days on and 21 days off). Treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was the rate of pts maintaining sonidegib 12 months after study enrolment (H0 31%, H1 60%). Evaluable pts were defined as all pts who were either on treatment or suspended treatment for reasons other than treatment-unrelated adverse events or death. Secondary endpoints were safety, treatment compliance, rate of disease relapse at 1 and 2 years, overall survival, quality of life, use of concomitant medications and of medical resources, and translational analysis. <b>Results:</b> Between Jan 2021 and Dec 2023, 22 pts from 10 Italian centers were enrolled; the data cut-off was Jan 2025. Pts characteristics are reported in table 1. The median follow-up was 22 months (range 2-33). Three disease and treatment-unrelated deaths occurred before completing 1 year of TS and therefore 19 pts were evaluable. At data cut-off, 12 pts had discontinued treatment: 26% (5) due to disease progression, 11% (2) to sonidegib’s unacceptable toxicity, the remaining either to personal or physician’s choice. Twelve out of 19 evaluable pts (63%) were still on treatment after 1 year from TS start (median duration 20 months, range 2-29), meeting the primary endpoint. The most common TRAEs episodes were muscle cramps (13), alopecia (6), dysgeusia (5) with overall TRAEs grade G1 (29), G2 (11), G3 (3). Twelve pts had dose reduction to TS2. <b>Conclusions:</b> Tailored maintenance schedule with pulsed sonidegib allows for longer treatment duration and fewer relapses in CR laBCC pts.

<b>Background:</b> TAPUR is a phase II basket study evaluating antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in pts with advanced cancers with genomic alt. Results of two cohorts of pts with BC or OC with <i>ERBB2/3</i> alt treated with P+T are reported. <b>Methods:</b> Eligible pts had measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, adequate organ function, and no standard treatment (tx) options. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. Recommended dosing was P at an initial dose of 840 mg intravenously (IV), then 420 mg IV every 3 weeks (wks) and T at an initial dose of 8 mg/kg IV, then 6 mg/kg IV every 3 wks until disease progression. Primary endpoint was disease control (DC) per investigator defined as complete (CR) or partial (PR) response per RECIST v.1.1, or stable disease (SD) of at least 16 wks duration (SD16+). CR was based on radiographic assessment. For both cohorts, Simon 2-stage design was based on a null DC rate of 15% vs. 35% (power = 0.85; α = 0.10). If ≥2 of 10 pts in stage I had DC, 18 more pts were enrolled; otherwise, the cohort was closed. If ≥7 of 28 pts had DC, the null DC rate was rejected. Secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response and SD, and safety. <b>Results:</b> 28 pts with <i>ERBB2/3</i> alt were enrolled in each cohort. The table shows demographics and outcomes. For the BC cohort, 2 CRs (<i>ERBB2</i> amplification [amp, n=1] and <i>ERBB2</i> amp and<i> ERBB3</i> mutation [mut, n=1]), 5 PRs (<i>ERBB2</i> amp [n=3], <i>ERBB2</i> amp and mut [n=1], and <i>ERBB2</i> mut [n=1]) and 3 SD16+ (<i>ERBB2</i> mut [n=3]) were observed for DC rate of 37% (90% CI, 24 to 100) and OR rate of 25% (95% CI, 11 to 45). The null DC rate was rejected (p=0.005). For the OC cohort, 2 PRs (<i>ERBB2</i> amp [n=1] and <i>ERBB2</i> mut [n=1]) and 3 SD16+ (<i>ERBB2</i> amp [n=2] and <i>ERBB2</i> amp and mut [n=1]) were observed for DC rate of 25% (90% CI, 10 to 100) and OR rate of 7% (95% CI, 1 to 24). The null DC rate was not rejected (p=0.29). Across both cohorts, 4 pts had 6 tx-related serious adverse events (SAE) including: infusion-related reaction, confusion, diarrhea, and fever, and 2 pts had 1 grade 3 tx-related adverse event (AE) each including: GGT increase and lymphopenia. No pts had grade 5 SAEs. <b>Conclusions:</b> P+T met prespecified criteria to declare clinical activity in pts with BC with <i>ERBB2</i> alt, but not in pts with OC. Additional study is warranted to confirm the efficacy of P+T in pts with BC with <i>ERBB2</i> alt. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02693535"">NCT02693535</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-485078-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-485078-001""><figcaption>Demographics and efficacy outcomes.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><td data-type=""border-bottom""> </td><th colspan=""2"" data-type=""border-bottom""><span>BC (N=28)</span></th><th colspan=""2"" data-type=""border-bottom""><span>OC (N=28)</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ECOG PS, N (%)</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>(21)</td><td>11</td><td>(39)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> </td><td>1</td><td>17</td><td>(61)</td><td>16</td><td>(57)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> </td><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>(18)</td><td>1</td><td>(4)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Prior systemic regimens, N (%)</td><td>1-2 <br/>≥3</td><td>6<br/>22</td><td>(21)<br/> (79)</td><td>13<br/>15</td><td>(46)<br/> (54)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">DC (OR plus SD16+) rate, % (90% CI), p-value</td><td> </td><td>37</td><td>(24, 100), p=0.005</td><td>25</td><td>(10, 100), p=0.29</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">OR rate, % (95% CI)</td><td> </td><td>25</td><td>(11, 45)</td><td>7</td><td>(1, 24)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Median PFS, wks (95% CI)</td><td> </td><td>13</td><td>(7, 22)</td><td>8</td><td>(8, 16)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Median OS, wks (95% CI)</td><td> </td><td>32</td><td>(17, 54)</td><td>44</td><td>(26, 89)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-485078-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Amulirafusp alfa (IMM0306) consists of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody fused with the CD47 binding domain of SIRPα. It exerts potent anti-cancer efficacy by activating both macrophages and NK cells via blockading of CD47-SIRPα interaction and FcɣR engagement. Lenalidomide was approved for relapsed or refractory (R/R) indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (iNHL). Here, we report results from a Phase II study of 34 patients with R/R CD20-positive follicular lymphoma (FL) (NCT05771883). <b>Methods:</b> Eligible patients with grade 1-3a FL received amulirafusp alfa 1.6 mg/kg intravenously once a week with lenalidomide 20 mg orally once a day on Days 1 to 21 in each 28-day cycle until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Safety was evaluated by CTCAE 5.0, tumor assessments performed every 8 weeks by Lugano 2014. <b>Results:</b> Until Dec 26, 2024, 34 patients with R/R FL were enrolled. Median age was 54, 20 (58.8%) were males, and 32 (94.1%) had stage III-IV disease. The median number of prior line therapy was 2. All patients received previous anti-CD20 therapy. Among 22 efficacy-evaluable patients, 10 CR, 8 PR, 2 SD and 2 PD were observed. The CRR and ORR were 45.5% and 81.8%, respectively. Of the 4 efficacy-evaluable patients who did not achieve response, 2 SD patients were both CD20 therapy refractory, 1 PD patient had histologic transformation and 1 PD patient were lenalidomide-resistant (had taken lenalidomide continuously for about 4 years). The most common treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) (≥ 20%) were PLT decreased (70.6%), WBC decreased (58.8%), anemia (52.9%), ANC decreased (52.9%), lymphocyte decreased (52.9%), infusion-related reactions (35.3%) and hypoalbuminaemia (23.5%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 22 (64.7%) patients, the most common ≥ grade 3 TRAEs (≥ 10%) were ANC decreased (29.4%), lymphocyte decreased (26.5%), PLT decreased (23.5%) and WBC decreased (11.8%). 5 (14.7%) patients experienced serious TRAE. 1 (2.9%) patient had a dose reduction of amulirafusp alfa, 5 (14.7%) patients had dose reductions of lenalidomide due to TRAEs. 1 (2.9%) patient experienced TRAE leading to the study drug discontinuation (Grade 4 Type I hypersensitivity, recovered with sequelae within 1 month). No patient experienced TRAE leading to death. There were no significant differences between amulirafusp alfa monotherapy and combination with lenalidomide in terms of PK exposure and ADA incidence rate. Pharmacodynamics analysis demonstrated amulirafusp alfa combine lenalidomide effectively depleted CD19<sup>+</sup>B cell in peripheral blood and achieved sustained long-term B cell depletion. <b>Conclusions:</b> Amulirafusp alfa in combination with lenalidomide showed a preliminary anti-tumor activity and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with R/R FL.

<b>Background:</b> There is limited evidence to guide adjuvant therapy in high-risk penile cancer. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with high-risk penile cancer [&gt; 1 inguinal lymph node (LN), perinodal extension, pelvic LN, or LN &gt; 4 cm] who underwent curative resection were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 cycles of platinum plus 5-FU (PF arm) or platinum plus paclitaxel (PP arm), followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), toxicities and quality of life (QoL). The study was approved by IEC and registered with CTRI. Recruitment began in March 2017 but closed prematurely due to slow accrual. <b>Results:</b> Between March 2017 and October 2024, 49 patients were randomized (Table 1). Median follow-up was 60.1 months. There was no significant difference in median PFS (12.5 vs 35.9 months, p=0.460), 5-year PFS (36.1% vs 38.5%), median OS (21.6 vs 37.2 months, p=0.530) and 5-year OS (45.3% vs 41.1%) between PF and PP arm, respectively. Dose reductions were higher (33.3% vs 4.5%, p=0.015), similar dose delays (33.3% vs 31.8%, p=0.916) and a non-significant increase in drug discontinuation (42.9% vs 18.2%, p=0.078) in the PF arm. Grade 3/4 hematological (28.6% vs 4.5%, p=0.033) and gastrointestinal (33.3% vs 4.5%, p=0.015) toxicities were higher in PF arm. Infections (9.5% vs 13.6%, p=0.674) and hospitalizations (38.1% vs 18.2%, p=0.146) were similar. QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30 and MSHQ) analysis showed no difference in global health status (p=0.094), functional and symptom scales. Patients in PF arm reported more erectile dysfunction-related bother (p=0.018) while other MSHQ domains were similar. <b>Conclusion:</b> Adjuvant platinum plus 5-FU showed similar efficacy to platinum plus paclitaxel in high-risk penile carcinoma after curative resection, albeit with higher hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities, as well as erectile dysfunction-related bother. <a>Clinical trial information: CTRI/2016/12/007567</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-497062-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-497062-001""><figcaption>Baseline and treatment details.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Characteristics</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">5-FU + Platinum<br/>(N = 25)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Paclitaxel + Platinum<br/>(N = 24)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Age (years)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Median (Range)</td><td>49 (29-70)</td><td>51 (26-70)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Co-morbidities</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Hypertension</td><td>5 (20%)</td><td>5 (20.8%)</td><td>0.942</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Diabetes Mellitus</td><td>5 (20%)</td><td>4 (16.7%)</td><td>0.763</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Coronary Artery Disease</td><td>3 (12%)</td><td>1 (4.2%)</td><td>0.317</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Prior phimosis</td><td>3 (12%)</td><td>1 (4.2%)</td><td>0.317</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Smoker or smokeless tobacco</td><td>9 (36%)</td><td>10 (41.7%)</td><td>0.773</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ECOG PS</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.715</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> 0</td><td>2 (8%)</td><td>1 (4.2%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> 1</td><td>21 (84%)</td><td>22 (91.6%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> 2</td><td>2 (8%)</td><td>1 (4.2%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Surgery</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.995</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Glansectomy</td><td>4 (16%)</td><td>4 (16.7%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Partial penectomy</td><td>17 (68%)</td><td>16 (66.6%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Total penectomy</td><td>4 (16%)</td><td>4 (16.7%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Degree of differentiation</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.566</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Grade 1</td><td>2 (8%)</td><td>2 (8.3%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Grade 2</td><td>12 (48%)</td><td>8 (33.3%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Grade 3</td><td>11 (44%)</td><td>14 (58.3%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathological T stage</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.525</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> T1</td><td>10 (40%)</td><td>6 (25%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> T2</td><td>8 (32%)</td><td>9 (37.5%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> T3</td><td>7 (28%)</td><td>9 (37.5%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathological N stage</td><td> </td><td> </td><td>0.950</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> N2</td><td>4 (16%)</td><td>4 (16.7%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> N3</td><td>21 (84%)</td><td>20 (8.3%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">LVI or PNI</td><td>11 (44%)</td><td>9 (37.5%)</td><td>0.644</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">&gt; 3 adjuvant cycles</td><td>15 (60%)</td><td>22 (91.6%)</td><td><b>0.010</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Completed CTRT</td><td>12 (48%)</td><td>14 (58.3%)</td><td>0.469</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-497062-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> TAPUR is a phase II basket study evaluating antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in pts with advanced cancers with genomic alterations. Results in a cohort of pts with OC with <i>CDKN2A </i>alterations treated with palbociclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, are reported. <b>Methods:</b> Eligible pts had measurable disease, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-2, adequate organ function, and no standard treatment (tx) options. Tumors must not have had mutations (mut) in the <i>RB</i> gene. Genomic testing was performed in CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited site selected labs. Palbociclib dosing was one 125 mg capsule taken orally once daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off, until disease progression. Primary endpoint was disease control (DC) per investigator defined as complete or partial (PR) response per RECIST v. 1.1, or stable disease (SD) of at least 16 weeks (wks) duration (SD16+). Simon 2-stage design was based on a null DC rate of 15% vs. 35% (power = 0.85; α = 0.10). If ≥2 of 10 pts in stage I had DC, 18 more pts were enrolled; otherwise, the cohort was closed. If ≥7 of 28 pts had DC, the null DC rate was rejected. Secondary endpoints were objective response (OR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR) and SD, and safety. DOR is defined as time from pt’s first documented OR to progressive disease (PD). Duration of SD is defined as time from tx initiation to PD. <b>Results:</b> From February 2017 to April 2023, 28 pts with OC were enrolled. Table shows demographics and outcomes. Genomic profiling showed <i>CDKN2A </i>deletion (del; n=20), <i>CDKN2A </i>mut (n=4), or both <i>CDKN2A </i>mut and del (n=3). Most common co-alterations were in: <i>CDKN2B</i> (n=17), <i>TP53</i> (n=15), and <i>PIK3CA</i> (n=5). 3 PRs (<i>CDKN2A</i> del [n=3]) and 7 SD16+ (<i>CDKN2A</i> del [n=5]; <i>CDKN2A</i> mut [n=1]; CDKN2A mut and del [n=1]) were observed for DC rate of 37% (90% CI, 24 to 100) and OR rate of 11% (95% CI, 2 to 28). The null DC rate was rejected (p=0.005). All but 1 pt with DC had serous carcinoma histology. DORs for 2 pts with PR were 26 and 60 wks. 1 pt had a PR at their final visit, decided to end study procedures, and DOR is not available.

<b>Background:</b> In HER2+ advanced breast cancer (ABC), standard treatment has been anti-HER2 therapy with chemotherapy, regardless of hormone receptor status. While prior studies support the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy in pretreated HR+/HER2+ ABC, data on their first line use without chemotherapy are limited. This study investigates ribociclib, trastuzumab, and letrozole as a first-line combination in HR+/HER2+ ABC. <b>Methods:</b> This multicenter, single-arm, prospective trial was conducted across 17 academic institutions in South Korea (NCT03913234). Eligible patients were HR+/HER2+ ABC with no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease. The Phase IB study used a 3+3 design to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RPIID) of ribociclib with fixed doses of letrozole (2.5 mg QD) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading, then 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks). The Phase II trial evaluated efficacy and safety at the RPIID. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), targeting an improvement from 8 to 12 months. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and safety. PAM50 testing assessed correlations between intrinsic subtype and treatment efficacy. <b>Results:</b> Phase IB (n = 13) identified the RPIID as ribociclib 600 mg QD, with one dose-limiting toxicity (Grade 3 ALT elevation) at 400 mg. In Phase II, 77 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 61 years (range 31–85), 18.2% (14/77) premenopausal, 66.2% (51/77) HER2 IHC 3+ and recurrent disease in 64.9% (50/77). 66.2% (51/77) had visceral metastases. At a median follow-up of 15.8 months (95% CI: 12.9-19.1) months, the median PFS was 30.4 months (95% CI: 19.6–NA), meeting the primary endpoint. The median OS was not reached. The ORR was 61.1%, including 3 complete and 41 partial responses, with a DOR of 11.8 months (95% CI: 7.6-13.4). Common adverse events included neutropenia (66.7%), pruritus (24.4%), and nausea (22.2%). There was a death reported due to aortic aneurysm. PAM50 analysis in 75 patients (phase IB/II) showed no significant correlation between intrinsic subtype and efficacy. <b>Conclusions:</b> Ribociclib, trastuzumab, and letrozole as first-line therapy in HR+/HER2+ ABC demonstrated a median PFS of 30.4 months with a manageable safety profile, supporting its potential as a chemotherapy-free option. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03913234"">NCT03913234</a>.",Breast Cancer—Metastatic,NCT03913234

<b>Background:</b> Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) can improve surgical outcomes; however, many patients fail to achieve pathological complete response (pCR). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 show promise, but responses are limited. This phase II trial evaluates cadonilimab (AK104), a bispecific PD-1/CTLA-4 antibody, combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in neoadjuvant TNBC to improve pCR rates and assess safety. <b>Methods:</b> This phase II, single-arm trial enrolled patients aged 18-75 with treatment-naïve, stage IA-IIIC triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients received cadonilimab (10 mg/kg) plus nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m²) and carboplatin (AUC 4) every 3 weeks for six cycles, followed by surgery within 4 weeks. Biopsy specimens were collected before treatment for whole-exome sequencing. The primary endpoint was total pathological complete response (tpCR) rate (ypT0/is ypN0). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), disease-free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. <b>Results:</b> A total of 29 patients were enrolled from January 31, 2023, to January 20, 2025. The median age was 53 years, and 11 patients (37.9%) were premenopausal. The majority had positive nodal involvement (75.9%) and stage III (51.7%) disease. of the 29 patients, 19 (65.5%, 95% CI: 45.7-82.1) achieved total pathological complete response (tpCR), and 21 (72.4%, 95% CI: 52.8-87.3) achieved breast pCR (bpCR). Tumor downstaging occurred in 89.7% (T) and 62.1% (N) of patients. Radiological assessments showed an objective response rate (ORR) of 93.1% (95% CI: 77.2-99.2) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 100%. All patients experienced at least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAEs), with 51.7% having grade 3/4 events, most commonly neutropenia (37.9%), platelet count decrease (19.2%), and leukopenia (17.2%). Serious TRAEs occurred in 6.9%. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade occurred in 14 (48.0%) patients, while those of grade ≥ 3 occurred in only one patient (3.4%). The most common irAE was hypothyroidism (44.8%, 13/29), all were grade 1 or 2. Notably, patients with <i>TASOR2</i> or <i>MST1R</i> mutation demonstrated a significantly lower pCR rate (both <i>P</i>=0.041). Additionally, <i>CCND1</i> amplification showed a non-significant negative trend with the pCR rate (<i>P</i>=0.051). <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of cadonilimab, nab-paclitaxel, and carboplatin in neoadjuvant treatment for stage IA-IIIC TNBC showed promising efficacy, with high response rates and significant tumor downstaging, particularly in stage III patients. The regimen was well tolerated with manageable adverse events, supporting its further investigation as a potential neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC. <a>Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2200067005</a>.",Breast Cancer—Local/Regional/Adjuvant,ChiCTR2200067005

<b>Background:</b> Alectinib is a next generation oral inhibitor of ALK-fusion proteins, being investigated in children and adolescents with ALK-fusion bearing tumors at diagnosis or relapse. Here we present updated safety and efficacy data from the iMATRIX Alectinib phase I-II study (NCT04774718). <b>Methods:</b> Patients, less than 18 years of age, with ALK fusion-positive solid or CNS tumors for whom prior treatment had proven to be ineffective or for whom there was no satisfactory treatment available were eligible. Patients were recruited to Part 1 to confirm the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to monitor drug pharmacokinetics. Investigators reported Best Overall Response according to RANO (CNS tumors) or RECIST v1.1 (solid tumors) criteria with a data cut off of July 2024. <b>Results:</b> In total 22 patients with a median age of 8 years were enrolled. Fourteen patients were diagnosed with solid tumors: inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (n = 9), renal cell carcinoma (n = 2), mesothelioma (n = 1), nephroblastoma (n = 1), and atypical melanocytic tumor (n = 1). Six patients were diagnosed with CNS tumors: high grade glioma (n = 5) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (n = 1). Two patients had ineligible conditions: histiocytosis (n = 1) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 1). Among the 22 patients, 14 had not received prior systemic therapy. ALK fusion partners were EML4 and CLTC in 3 patients, TPM3 and KIF5C in 2 patients, and DCTN1, FN1, KIF5B, NPM, PPP1CB, STRN, CLIP1, RANBP2, ZEB2, PLEKHA7, CDC42BPB and HNRNPA3 in 1 patient each. In the 21 safety evaluable patients, only 1 DLT of Grade 3 increased alanine aminotransferase, in the context of multiple viral infections, was reported. The DLT resolved after treatment interruption and Alectinib was restarted at a reduced dose level, and then tolerated well. Eighteen patients (86%) experienced at least one Adverse Event (AE) reported as related to Alectinib, the majority being of Grade 1 and 2 severity. Grade ≥ 3 AEs related to alectinib were reported for 5 patients (23.8%) and there were 2 patients with serious AEs related to Alectinib. There were no new safety signals detected. Investigator reported Best Overall Response rate in 16 patients was 87.5%; (14 PRs) and 2 patients were reported to have stable disease. A partial response was observed in 5/5 evaluable patients with CNS tumors and in 9/11 evaluable patients with solid tumours. Six patients were excluded from the efficacy analysis due to ineligible tumor type (n = 2), not dosed (n = 1), no measurable disease according to RANO criteria (n = 1) or lack of response assessment by the analysis cut-off date (n = 2). <b>Conclusions:</b> Alectinib continues to have a favourable safety profile in pediatric patients. Despite this being a very challenging population to treat, clinical efficacy results are transformational with the majority of patients experiencing a tumor response. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04774718"">NCT04774718</a>.",Pediatric Oncology,NCT04774718

<b>Background:</b> The standard first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). However, co-existing mutations can reduce the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs, and combination treatments may offer superior outcomes. Some studies suggest that the combination of Osimertinib and Anlotinib may enhance anti-tumor activity. This study explores the efficacy and safety of this combination as a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with EGFR co-existing mutations. <b>Methods:</b> This prospective, multicenter phase II trial enrolled patients (pts) with untreated, advanced NSCLC carrying EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations plus at least one additional mutation in TP53, PI3KCA, or RB1. pts received oral Osimertinib (80 mg daily) and Anlotinib (10 mg daily for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week off), repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary endpoints included median overall survival (mOS), median PFS (mPFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. Exploratory analyses evaluated changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and their correlation with clinical outcomes. <b>Results:</b> As of June 24, 2024, 38 pts (median age 65 years; 39.5% male; 78.9% ECOG PS 1) were enrolled. EGFR mutations included exon 19 deletions (47.4%) and L858R (52.6%), with co-existing mutations in TP53 (78.9%), PI3KCA (28.9%), and RB1 (2.6%). At baseline, 47.4% of pts had brain metastases. With a median follow-up of 14.5 months, the 1-year PFS rate was 85% (95% CI: 70%-95%), and median PFS was 29.0 months (95% CI: 22.5-NA). The ORR was 76.7%, and DCR was 97.4%. Among the 18 pts with brain metastases, the ORR was 83.3%, and median PFS was 22.3 months (95% CI: 14.6-30.4). All pts experienced treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), with 18.3% having Grade 3 or higher TRAEs. Common TRAEs included rash (81.6%), hand-foot syndrome (71.1%), oral mucositis (50.0%), hypertension (60.5%), liver function impairment (47.4%), decreased appetite (44.7%), and diarrhea (36.8%). In the 11 pts monitored via next-generation sequencing (NGS), ctDNA clearance post-treatment correlated significantly with improved PFS (median PFS: NR vs. 17.8 months, P=0.015). <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of Osimertinib and Anlotinib shows promising efficacy and manageable toxicity as a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with EGFR co-existing mutations, particularly in pts with brain metastases. Post-treatment ctDNA clearance appears to be a potential biomarker for predicting therapeutic response and prognosis. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings and explore personalized treatment strategies in NSCLC. <a>Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2300070023</a>.",Lung Cancer—Non-Small Cell Metastatic,ChiCTR2300070023

<b>Background:</b> rEECur, the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) in RR-ES, has previously defined high dose ifosfamide (IFOS) as the most effective regimen in this setting compared to gemcitabine-docetaxel, irinotecan-temozolomide and topotecan-cyclophosphamide. Platinum drugs show activity in RR-ES and are frequently given with etoposide in this setting. <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged at least 2 years with RR-ES were randomised to 3-week cycles of either IFOS 15 g/m<sup>2</sup> by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days or IV carboplatin 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> day 1 and etoposide 120 mg/m<sup>2</sup> days 1 to 3 (CE). Primary outcome was event-free survival time (EFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival time (OS), toxicity and quality of life (QoL). A probability-based Bayesian approach was used. <b>Results:</b> 139 patients recruited between 22/03/21 and 28/05/24, were randomised 1:1 to IFOS (n = 69) or CE (70). Median age was 18 years (range 3-59). Patients had refractory disease (14%), 1<sup>st</sup> recurrence (81%), &gt; 1<sup>st</sup>recurrence (6%). Sites of progression were primary site only (21%), pleuropulmonary metastases only (24%), and other or combined metastatic disease (55%). More CE patients had baseline GFR &lt; 90 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>(41% versus 23%). Median follow-up (reverse Kaplan-Meier) was 18 months (mos). Median EFS was 5.1 mos (95% CI 3.1, 6.3) for IFOS and 3.5 mos (95% CI 2.5, 6.1) for CE. Median OS was 14.4 mos (95% CI 11.5, 20.7) for IFOS and 19.0 mos (95% CI 11.2, 24.6) for CE. Given the observed data the posterior probabilities that EFS and OS were better after IFOS than after CE (ie Pr[true hazard ratio &gt; 1 | data]) were 87% and 55% respectively. Grade 3+ adverse events present in &gt; 5% of patients randomised to IFOS (left hand values) compared with CE were febrile neutropenia (30% v 10%), anaemia (9% v 9%) and thrombocytopenia (3% v 7%). Acute kidney injury was present in 2% v 0% and encephalopathy in 5% v 0%. There were no measurable differences in QoL. <b>Conclusions:</b> There was insufficient evidence of efficacy with CE compared to IFOS to continue recruitment to phase III in this first RCT of a platinum-etoposide combination in RR-ES. IFOS remains the most effective regimen in this disease setting. The trial remains open, comparing IFOS with and without the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib.

<b>Background:</b> Novel combination strategies are being explored to enhance the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Prostaglandin E2, through its receptor 4 (EP4), is a major contributor to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. In a dose-response phase I/II study, the EP4 antagonist vorbipiprant (CR6086) combined with PD-1 blockade was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in refractory mismatch-repair-proficient/microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) (Pietrantonio et al, Clin Cancer Res 2024). Here we report the results from a study extension in non-colorectal gastrointestinal (GI) cancers with the vorbipiprant dose selected for further development in combination with immunotherapy. <b>Methods:</b> Twenty-seven adult patients (pts) with metastatic non-colorectal GI cancers, ECOG PS ≤1, and ≥1 prior treatment line were included in 3 cohorts (9 pts each): gastric cancer (GC) with PD-L1 Combined Positive Score (CPS) ≥5 (cohort A), GC with PD-L1 CPS &lt; 5 (cohort B), and GI cancers other than CRC and GC (cohort C). Pts receive oral vorbipiprant (90 mg twice daily) plus iv balstilimab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or death. Primary endpoints are safety and disease control rate (DCR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include objective response rate, progression-free and overall survival (ORR, PFS, OS). Exploratory endpoints include tissue and blood biomarkers. <b>Results:</b> At a cutoff date of November 20, 2024, enrolment is completed. In cohort C, we enrolled: 5 BTC, 2 pancreatic and 2 ampullary cancer patients. Overall, median age was 61 (interquartile range: 55-68) years, similar among cohorts; 70% were men, with a slightly higher prevalence in Cohort A; the median number of prior treatment lines was 3 (IQR: 2-4) overall and in gastric cohorts, and 2 (IQR: 2-3) in other GI cancers cohort. Prior ICIs were administered in 44%, 22% and 11% in Cohort A, B and C, respectively. No treatment-related serious or grade &gt; 3 adverse events were reported. Promising activity was observed. In cohort A, 3 pts had a partial response (PR), 2 of them still ongoing and 2 lasting more than 6 months; in addition, 1 pt had stable disease (SD). In cohort B, 4 pts had SD, 1 of them still ongoing and 2 lasting more than 6 months. In cohort C, 1 pt with pancreatic cancer had a PR, still ongoing for &gt; 6 months; in addition, 1 BTC patient had SD. Median PFS and OS were: 4,5 and 9,7 months in Cohort A, 1,8 and 6,8 months in Cohort B, 2,0 and 4,5 months in Cohort C. Responses occurred irrespective of MSI/MMR status and prior exposure to ICIs. <b>Conclusions:</b> Vorbipiprant combined with PD-1 blockade was well tolerated and showed signs of activity in non-colorectal GI cancers, thus confirming a broader spectrum of activity on top of the results in MSS CRC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05205330"">NCT05205330</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05205330

<b>Background:</b> Becotatug vedotin (MRG003) is a novel EGFR-targeted antibody-drug conjugate. Previous Phase I/II studies have demonstrated optimistic efficacy in R/M NPC pts who had failed platinum chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor. This study aimed to assess clinical efficacy and safety of MRG003 in pts compared with chemotherapy. <b>Method:</b> Eligible pts with R/M NPC had failed ≥2 lines of systemic chemotherapy and PD-(L)1 inhibitor, and were randomized to receive MRG003 (2.3 mg/kg, d1, iv, Q3W) or chemotherapy (capecitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, po, twice daily, d1-14, Q3W; or docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, iv, d1, Q3W). Randomization was stratified according to liver metastasis (yes or no) and ECOG PS (0 or 1). The primary endpoints were ORR and PFS assessed by BICR, and OS. Pts in the chemotherapy arm were allowed to cross over to receive MRG003 after disease progression. <b>Result:</b> A total of 173 R/M NPC pts were randomly assigned to MRG003 (n=86) or capecitabine(n=36)/docetaxel (n=51). The median prior treatment lines (range) were 3 (2-10) vs. 3 (2-11), and the ECOG score 0 was 17.4% vs. 17.2% for two arms. 40 pts (46.5%) vs. 41 pts (47.1%) of two arms had liver metastasis. By 30 June 2024, the study reached the significantly improved BICR-assessed ORR with MRG003 compared to chemotherapy (30.2% vs. 11.5%, difference: 18.7%, 95%CI: 7.0%, 30.5%, P=0.0025). Also, PFS was significantly improved in the MRG003 arm (HR=0.63, 95%CI: 0.43, 0.91, P=0.0146). Median PFS (95%CI) by BICR were 5.8m (4.2, 6.2) vs. 2.8m (2.0, 5.5). As of 30 December 2024, the updated mOS (95%CI) were 17.1m (11.4, NE) vs. 12.0m (9.7, 15.4) of two arms (HR=0.73, 95%CI: 0.48, 1.12). By supplementary analysis excluding the impact of crossover treatment, the HR of OS was 0.59 (95%CI: 0.37, 0.93). MRG003 has shown a trend of survival benefits. The OS will be continually followed up. The incidence of adverse events in the two arms was similar. 39 pts (45.3%) vs.44 pts (50.6%) in two arms experienced grade ≥3 TRAEs. White blood cell count decreased was the most common grade ≥3 TRAE of two arms (9.3% vs. 35.6%). <b>Conclusions:</b> As the first ADC clinical study targeting heavily pretreated R/M NPC, becotatug vedotin demonstrated statistically and clinically meaningful benefits while maintaining a manageable safety profile in this population. This study will lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of R/M NPC.

<b>Background:</b> The 1st and 2<sup>nd</sup> interim analyses of the CATNON trial on anaplastic glioma (NCT00626990) showed benefit from adjuvant (adj) temozolomide (TMZ) on overall survival (OS) in patients with IDH mutant (mt) tumors, but no benefit of concurrent (conc) TMZ regardless of Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH) mutation (mt) status. We now present the final analysis and the exploratory molecular marker analysis of the study. <b>Methods:</b> The 2x2 factorial design phase III CATNON trial randomized 751 adult patients with newly diagnosed non-codeleted anaplastic glioma to either 59.4 Gy radiotherapy (RT) alone; the same RT with concTMZ; the same RT and 12 cycles of adjTMZ or the same RT with both concTMZ and adjTMZ. Methylation status including <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation status were assessed with the Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip. IDH mutation (mt) status and glioma specific alterations were assessed with a glioma targeted panel using Agilent SureSelect baits. <b>Results:</b> After a median follow-up of 10.9 years and with 499 events observed, in the intent-to-treat population the hazard ratio (HR) for OS adjusted for stratification factors after concTMZ was 0.906 (95%CI 0.760, 1.082; p=0.28) and after adjTMZ 0.647 (95%CI 0.541, 0.773; p &lt;0.0001). In 660 patients IDH status could be determined: IDH was mt in 444 tumors and wild type (wt) in 216 tumors. Median OS was 1.7 yrs in patients with IDHwt tumors and 8.5 years in patients with IDHmt tumors. Benefit to TMZ was limited to patients with anaplastic glioma IDHmt of which 199 were still alive (45%). For patients with IDHmt tumors the HR for concTMZ was 0.81 (95% CI 0.63-1.04; p=0.09) and for adjTMZ 0.54 (95% CI 0.42-0.69,p &lt; 0.0001). No benefit was observed of concTMZ in IDHmt glioma patients that also received adjTMZ (HR 0.92 95% CI 0.63-1.36; p=0.69). In patients with IDHmt tumors that had received any TMZ median OS was 10.3 years, the median OS in patients treated with adjTMZ was 12.5 years (95% CI 9.4-15.0; p&lt;0.0001). In exploratory analysis, high-copy number Amplification of <i>PDGFR</i> and <i>CDK4</i>; Homozygous deletion of the <i>CDKN2A/B</i> locus, total copy number alterations, methylation subtype (A_IDH vs A_IDH_HG, G-CIMP high versus low, <i>MGMT</i>-promoter methylation as determined by methylation arrays) were all associated with outcome but none was predictive for benefit to TMZ. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite more follow-up, concTMZ did not improve OS regardless of IDH status. AdjTMZ increased OS in patients with IDHmt tumors but not in patients with IDHwt tumors. Molecular factors of known prognostic significance for IDHmt 1p/19q intact anaplastic glioma did not predict benefit to TMZ. Median OS in patients with IDHmt glioma having received adjTMZ after RT was 12.5 years. Standard of post-operative care in patients with high grade IDHmt astrocytoma should be RT followed by 12 cycles adjTMZ.

<b>Background:</b> Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has achieved significant success in targeted tumor cells eradication. However, data on CAR-T therapies in NSCLC remain limited. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of CEA CAR-T cell therapy in r/r NSCLC. <b>Methods:</b> Adult metastatic NSCLC patients with relapse after ≥2 lines of treatment were enrolled and administered intravenous CEA CAR-T cells at three dose levels (0.75×10<sup>6</sup>, 1.5×10<sup>6</sup>, and 3×10<sup>6</sup> CEA CAR-T cells/kg).Peripheral blood samples were collected on day 28 post-infusion and analyzed using 10x Genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).The primary endpoint was safety, and secondary endpoints including efficacy and pharmacological evaluation. <b>Results:</b> From August 1, 2023, to July 15, 2024, a total of 18 patients were screened, and 15 received CAR-T infusion. The median age was 60 years, with a median of 4 prior therapy lines (range 2-10 lines). Among 6 patients receiving the maximum dose (3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/kg), no dose-limiting toxicities, grade 4 cytokine release syndrome or ICANS were observed. No adverse events were observed during a three-month long-term safety evaluation. With a median follow-up of 5.7 months, 7 patients achieved PR, 6 had SD, and 2 experienced PD. The best DCR was 87%, and ORR was 47%. Notably, patients with ≥30% intense and complete CEA staining in tumor cells and no brain metastases showed better PFS (72.7% vs. 25.0%, p=0.03) and OS (90.9% vs. 0%, p=0.003). CEA CAR-T cells reached maximum concentration at a median of 10 days (range 7–60 days) post-infusion. At the third month, all 12/12 patients with available CAR-T cell copy number data maintained high levels of CAR-T cells, with a median of 8,236 gDNA copies/μg, and in the patient with a follow-up of 13 months, CEA CAR-T cells were still detectable at 50,760 gDNA copies/μg. The scRNA-seq was performed in 12 patients. Responders exhibited a higher percentage of NK cells in a less exhausted state, characterized by reduced activity of immunosuppressive pathways and lower expression of stress-associated genes. Further cell-cell communication analysis suggested HLA-DRB1 expression in NK cells might be influenced by interactions with the CD244 in CD8⁺ T cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> A single infusion of hypoxia-responsive CEA CAR-T demonstrated promising efficacy and manageable safety in r/r NSCLC. The findings highlight the potential role of specific NK cell states and immune interactions in the therapeutic effects of CEA CAR-T therapy.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-484016-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-484016-001""><figcaption>Clinical response at different doses.</figcaption><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">All dose level<br/>(n=15)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Dose level 1<br/>(n=3)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Dose level 2<br/>(n=6)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Dose level 3<br/>(n=6)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Disease control</td><td>13 (87%)</td><td>2 (66%)</td><td>6 (100%)</td><td>5 (84%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Overall response</td><td>7 (47%)</td><td>1 (33%)</td><td>4 (67%)</td><td>2 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Partial response</td><td>7 (47%)</td><td>1 (33%)</td><td>4 (67%)</td><td>2 (33%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Disease stable</td><td>6 (40%)</td><td>1 (33%)</td><td>2 (33%)</td><td>3 (50%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-484016-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">Data are n (%).</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has been the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) for over 20 years. However, 30-40% of treated patients have recurrence or progression within 5 years. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 53 patients with LACC who were treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from May 2023 to November 2024 were prospectively collected and randomly divided into the CCRT group (N = 26) and the CCRT+T group (N = 27). The treatment plan was as follows: 200 mg of tislelizumab was intravenously infused on the first day of radiotherapy, once every 3 weeks, for 1 year or until disease progression or intolerable toxicity, whichever occurred first. Chemotherapy involved single-agent cisplatin at a dose of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>. External irradiation used 6MV-X-ray intensity-modulated radiotherapy with a dose of 45-50Gy/25f. Simultaneously, peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were detected in the enrolled patients before and at the end of radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was the objective response rate, and secondary endpoints included toxicity, PFS and OS. <b>Results:</b> Follow-up was completed by January 2025, with a median follow-up time of 13.7 months (5.2-20.5 months) in the CCRT group and 11.2 months (5.9-20.6 months) in the CCRT+T group. The CCRT+T group had higher complete response (CR) and objective response rates (ORR) compared to the CCRT group, with CR rates of 44.4% versus 19.2% (p = 0.035) and ORR rates of 100% versus 84.6% (p = 0.046). The patients with CR were subjected to logistic regression analysis. The results of univariate and multivariate analysis showed that CD4+T cell percentage (p = 0.034) and tislelizumab use (p = 0.038) were significantly associated with CR. However, no statistical difference was observed in the OS (p = 0.414) and PFS (p = 0.716) between the two groups, as shown by the Kaplan-Meier survival curves. After treatment, the CCRT+T group had increased levels of total T cell percentage, CD4+T cell percentage, CD4/CD8, double positive T lymphocyte subset percentage, absolute T lymphocyte count, absolute CD4+T lymphocyte count, and B lymphocyte (CD19) compared to the CCRT group. Notably, the double positive T lymphocyte subset percent (p = 0.025) and absolute CD4+T lymphocyte count (p = 0.047) showed significant increases. There was no significant difference in the incidence of acute adverse reactions between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> CCRT+T demonstrated superior short-term efficacy in treating LACC compared to CCRT, although long-term efficacy necessitates further follow-up observation. The combination of tislelizumab and CCRT in the treatment of LACC can improve the levels of T cell subsets, with tolerable acute toxic and good safety. CD4+T cell percentage and tislelizumab use may be associated with CR.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,

<b>Background:</b> The standard STUPP regimen (radiotherapy with temozolomide [TMZ] followed by adjuvant TMZ) remains limited in efficacy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). Anlotinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting tumor angiogenesis and proliferation, showed promising progression-free survival (PFS) in a prior single-arm trial (NCT04119674). This multicenter, double-blind, randomized phase II trial (NCT04959500) evaluates STUPP plus anlotinib versus STUPP plus placebo. <b>Methods:</b> Eligible patients (≥18 years, ECOG ≤2) are randomized 1:1 to receive anlotinib (10 mg/day, days 1–14 per 21-day cycle) or placebo alongside TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy (54–60 Gy). Patients undergo six TMZ cycles and eight anlotinib/placebo cycles after radiotherapy, then receiving anlotinib/placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Key exclusions include brainstem-only tumors, prior GBM therapy, IDH1/2 mutations, or significant intracranial hemorrhage. The primary endpoint is Independent Review Committee (IRC)-assessed PFS. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), investigator-assessed PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and safety. With 150 patients (targeting 110 PFS events), the study has 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.58, at a two-sided alpha level of 5%. Efficacy is analyzed in intent-to-treat populations using Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests, with ORR 95% CIs calculated via exact binomial methods. <b>Results:</b> A total of 153 patients were randomized in this study, 77 patients were in the anlotinib group and 76 patients were in the placebo group. Baseline characteristics were balanced. In the anlotinib (ALTN) and placebo (PLB) group, the median age was 55.4 and 55.1 years, 64 and 62 patients had an ECOG PS of 0-1, rate of MGMT methylation was 32.47% and 31.58%, respectively. The median follow-up duration was 27.53 months (95% CI 25.46-29.93) and 31.05 months (95% CI 26.25, 32.72) in the ALTN and PLB group. The median PFS evaluated by IRC was 9.89 months (95% CI 9.10, 11.56) in the ALTN group, 5.85 months (95% CI 3.58, 7.69) in the PLB group [HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42,0.85), <i>p</i>= 0.0043]. The ORR evaluated by IRC was 16.88% (95% CI 9.31,27.14) in the ALTN group, 5.26% (95% CI 1.45,12.93) in the PLB group [<i>p</i>= 0.0220]. The most frequent grade 3 or higher toxicities in the ALTN and PLB group were thrombocytopenia (7.79% vs 1.32%), neutropenia (6.49% vs 3.95%), lymphocyte count decreased (6.49% vs 7.89%), white blood cell count decreased(6.49% vs 2.63%) and hypertension (5.19% vs 0%). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study had reached the primary endpoint of PFS evaluated by IRC, further data will be analyzed based on molecular pathology when OS data is mature. The combination of ALTN and STUPP regimen showed very good efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with newly diagnosed GBM, with a simple and feasible treatment process. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04959500"">NCT04959500</a>.",Central Nervous System Tumors,NCT04959500

<b>Background:</b> ATC patients present with advanced, often surgically unresectable disease with historically dismal prognosis. Median PFS and OS of DT without pembrolizumab were 6.7 and 13.5 months, respectively, in the ROAR trial. Neoadjuvant DTP achieved locoregional control without radical surgery in a retrospective series of <i>BRAF</i>m-ATC patients, providing rationale to evaluate efficacy and safety in a phase 2 prospective trial. <b>Methods:</b> In this single-arm multicenter phase 2 trial, patients with <i>BRAF</i>m-ATC<i> </i>stage IVB/IVC were enrolled in 5 US centers. Following a 3-6 week run-in with D (150 mg BID) and T (2 mg daily), P (200 mg Q3W) was added, with restaging every three (21-day) cycles. Post-operatively, patients continued P (or DTP) with radiotherapy or transitioned directly to adjuvant DTP (up to 26 cycles). Primary endpoints included R0/R1 resection rate (historically 5%) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included RECIST 1.1 response after DTP and progression-free survival (PFS). <b>Results:</b> Between 9/2021-1/2025, 42 patients were enrolled; 36 are included in the current analysis (3 not evaluable, 3 pending surgery) (Table). Patients received median 4 (range: 2-7) neoadjuvant DTP cycles, with 26 (72%) achieving radiographic PR/CR. 30 patients (83%) had surgery after neoadjuvant DTP, achieving R0/R1 resection in 29/30 (97%). Mean surgical morbidity score (0-4 scale, 4=unresectable) improved from 3.3 to 1.6 after DTP (p&lt;0.01). Complete ATC pathologic response occurred in 20/30 patients (67%), while 10/30 (33%) had residual ATC in the surgical specimen. Postoperatively, 11/30 (37%) received adjuvant neck radiation, and 28/36 (78%) completed a median of 11 (range: 1-26) adjuvant DTP cycles. With median follow up 18 months, 15/36 (42%) patients died. Median OS was 20 months (95% CI: 12.6-NR); 1- and 2-year OS were 71% and 48%. Complete pathologic responders had better 2-year OS than those with residual ATC (69% vs. 22%, p=0.02). Median PFS was 13.9 months (95% CI, 7.5-NR); 1- and 2-year PFS were 57% and 36%. Grade 5 adverse events occurred in 8 patients (22%), including one possible (duodenal perforation), one probable (kidney injury with sepsis), and 6 unlikely/unrelated treatment-related deaths. <b>Conclusions:</b> Neoadjuvant DTP enables surgical resection in<b><i> </i></b><i>BRAF</i>m-ATC compared with historical controls, and leads to improved PFS and OS. This approach should now be considered a standard of care for <i>BRAF</i>m-ATC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04675710"">NCT04675710</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-502566-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-502566-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Total N=36</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Age (y), median (range)</td><td>67 (46-86)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Stage IVB/IVC, n (%)</td><td>15 (42%)/21 (58%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Best RECIST response neoadjuvant phase, n (%)</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> CR</td><td>2 (6%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> PR</td><td>24 (67%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> SD</td><td>6 (17%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> PD</td><td>4 (11%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Percent change target lesion diameter, mean (95% CI)</td><td>-44% (-54%, -34%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Surgical morbidity score change, mean (95% CI)</td><td>-1.7 (-2.1, -1.3)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-502566-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Both Becotatug (JMT101, humanized IgG1 anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody [mAb]) ± chemotherapy, and Enlonstobart (SG001, humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 mAb), demonstrated promising antitumor activity with favorable safety in advanced solid tumors. This study evaluates the safety and preliminary efficacy of JMT101 + SG001 + irinotecan in patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (mCRC). <b>Methods:</b> This multicenter, randomized, open-label phase II study enrolled pts with histologically or cytologically confirmed RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC without MSI-H/dMMR, who had progressed after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapies. Upon dose confirmation in safety run-in part (SRI, 3-6 pts, JMT101 6 mg/kg + irinotecan 180 mg/m<sup>2</sup> + SG001 240 mg Q2W), eligible pts, stratified by PD-L1 expression (+/-), were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either JMT101 + irinotecan + SG001 (Arm A), JMT101 + irinotecan (Arm B), or regorafenib 160mg QD, days 1-21 of 28-day cycles (Arm C). The primary endpoint is the ORR per RECIST v1.1 by investigator. <b>Results:</b> After the SRI in 3 pts, 106 additional pts (median age 58 yrs [25-74], 62.3% male) were randomized (36/35/35 in Arm A/B/C). As of Jan 24, 2025, all SRI pts and 69/106 (65.1%) randomized pts (18/21/30 in Arm A/B/C) completed treatment. The median follow-up was 7.4 months, with 34, 35, 34 efficacy-evaluable pts in Arm A, B, and C, respectively. Detailed efficacy data are shown in the table. Arm A and B had comparable ORR, DCR, and PFS, all statistically superior to Arm C. The median OS was not reached. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 38.9% (14/36), 54.3% (19/35), and 48.6% (17/35) pts in Arm A, B, and C, respectively. No TRAEs led to discontinuation in Arm A/B, compared to 2/35 (5.7%) in Arm C. No TRAEs leading to death occurred. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results demonstrated a promising response rate and a tolerable safety profile of JMT101 + irinotecan +/- SG001 in pts with mCRC. Preliminary data support continued investigation, with updated results to follow. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06089330"">NCT06089330</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-491474-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-491474-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap"" tabindex=""0""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">CR</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">PR</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">SD</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">PD</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">NE</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">ORR</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">RD*</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">DCR</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">RD<sup>*</sup></th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">6 mo-DoR</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">mPFS<br/>mo (95%CI)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">P value<sup>#</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">SRI</td><td>0</td><td>1 (33.3)</td><td>0</td><td>2 (66.7)</td><td>0</td><td>33.3 (0.84, 90.6)</td><td>/</td><td>33.3 (0.84, 90.6)</td><td>/</td><td>/</td><td>2.0 (0.92, NR)</td><td>/</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Arm A</td><td>0</td><td>15 (44.1)</td><td>13 (38.2)</td><td>4 (11.8)</td><td>2 (5.90)</td><td>44.1 (27.2, 62.1)</td><td>41.2 (23.7, 58.6)</td><td>82.4 (65.5, 93.2)</td><td>20.6 (0.06, 41.1)</td><td>48.0 (12.7, 77.0)</td><td>5.7 (3.75, NR)</td><td>0.003</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Arm B</td><td>0</td><td>12 (34.3)</td><td>18 (51.4)</td><td>5 (14.3)</td><td>0</td><td>34.3 (19.1, 52.2)</td><td>31.1 (14.6, 47.5)</td><td>85.7 (69.7, 95.2)</td><td>23.9 (3.85, 43.9)</td><td>71.4 (25.8, 92.0)</td><td>7.4 (3.91, NR)</td><td>&lt;0.001</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Arm C</td><td>0</td><td>1 (2.90)</td><td>20 (58.8)</td><td>13 (38.2)</td><td>0</td><td>2.9 (0.07, 15.3)</td><td>Ref.</td><td>61.8 (43.6, 77.8)</td><td>Ref.</td><td>/</td><td>2.9 (2.14, 3.71)</td><td>1.000</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-491474-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-491474-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">Data are n (%) or % (95% CI), unless noted.</div></div><div role=""doc-footnote""><sup>*</sup>Rate difference, analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.</div><div role=""doc-footnote""><sup>#</sup>Estimated via stratified log - rank test, stratifying by PD-L1 expression (+/-).</div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is frequently overexpressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and is linked to lineage plasticity and therapy resistance. In pre-clinical studies, EZH2 directly regulates DNA damage repair (DDR) gene expression, and inhibition of EZH2 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to genotoxic stress as induced by poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition. Here we report results of a Phase 1a/1b study of the combination of the PARP inhibitor talazoparib (tala) with the EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat (taz) in mCRPC. <b>Methods:</b> Eligible patients (pts) had progressive disease after at least one secondary hormonal therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy (or felt not to be more appropriate for taxane), disease evaluable for response (PSA ≥ 2 ng/ml or measurable disease by RECIST 1.1) and a metastatic lesion amenable to biopsy adequate for next generation sequencing. The starting dose level (DL 0) in Phase 1a was tala 0.75 mg QD + taz 600 mg BID with dose escalation/de-escalation of both agents by up to 2 dose levels based on a 3+3 design to define the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In Phase 1b, an additional 20 pts were treated at the RP2D to assess preliminary safety and efficacy. <b>Results:</b> 12 pts were treated in Phase 1a, of whom 2 of 11 DLT-evaluable pts experienced DLT (both Grade 4 thrombocytopenia): 0 of 3 at DL 0, 1 of 6 at DL +1 (tala 0.75 mg QD + taz 800 mg BID), and 1 of 2 at DL +2 (tala 1 mg QD + taz 800 mg BID). The other pt treated at DL +2 experienced Grade 3 anemia requiring transfusion just outside the DLT period, so DL +1 was selected as the RP2D. 27 pts were treated at the RP2D: 7 in Phase 1a (1 of whom was replaced due to progression prior to completion of the DLT period) and 20 pts in Phase 1b. Median PSA at enrollment was 21.8 ng/ml (range 0-3287), and median number of prior treatments was 4 (range 1-10). Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs were reported in 59% of pts (16/27), including thrombocytopenia (8/27, 29.6%), anemia (8/27, 29.6%), fatigue (4/27, 14.8%), neutropenia (3/27, 11.1%), lymphopenia (1/27, 3.7%), and hyperglycemia (1/27, 3.7%). 14 of 27 pts (51.8%) required dose reduction. Confirmed PSA50 response was seen in 3 of 23 PSA-evaluable pts (13.0%), and PSA30 in 4 of 23 (17.4%). 1 of 12 pts with measurable disease (8.3%) experienced unconfirmed radiographic response, and 6 of 27 pts (22.2%) remained on study treatment for &gt; 270 days. <b>Conclusions:</b> In a heavily pretreated biomarker-unselected population, the RP2D of talazoparib 0.75 mg daily and tazemetostat 800 mg BID was associated with expected myelosuppression but otherwise acceptable safety profile, with clinical benefit seen in a minority of patients. Companion blood and tissue-based correlative studies to characterize pharmacodynamic biomarkers of combined PARP+EZH2 inhibition and biomarkers of response and resistance are ongoing. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04846478"">NCT04846478</a>.","Genitourinary Cancer—Prostate, Testicular, and Penile",NCT04846478

<b>Background:</b> CIT is a common consequence of antineoplastic regimens for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, occurring in &gt;60% of colorectal cancer patients receiving multiagent chemotherapy. CIT can lead to chemotherapy dose reduction, delay, omission, and discontinuation, potentially worsening outcomes. There are no widely available licensed therapies for this unmet need. Aim: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim (ROMI) in patients with GI cancers to limit chemotherapy dose modifications from CIT. <b>Methods:</b> This was a phase 3, placebo (PBO)-controlled RCT of patients receiving oxaliplatin-based multiagent regimens for GI cancers with persistent CIT, ie platelets (Plt) ≤85×10<sup>9</sup>/L on day 1 of a scheduled chemotherapy cycle (NCT03362177). Patients from 55 sites in 14 countries were randomized 2:1 to ROMI or PBO for 3 chemotherapy cycles, stratified by baseline Plt (&lt; or ≥50×10<sup>9</sup>/L) and cancer type. Study drug started at 2 μg/kg subcutaneous weekly, adjusted weekly by 1 μg/kg up to 10 μg/kg to target Plt ≥100×10<sup>9</sup>/L in 12 weeks (≤4 weeks at 10 μg/kg). Chemotherapy started when Plt ≥100×10<sup>9</sup>/L (Plt response) or after week 4 per investigator. The primary endpoint was no CIT-induced dose modification of any myelosuppressive agent in either the second or third<sup> </sup>chemotherapy cycle per independent adjudication committee. <b>Results:</b> Patients (N=165; 109 ROMI, 56 PBO) had colorectal (75%), gastroesophageal (13%), or pancreatic (12%) cancer; 60% were male, 90% White, 4% Black, and 24% Hispanic, with mean (SD) age of 61.4 (11.1) years. Baseline median (range) Plt was 69 (8–85)×10<sup>9</sup>/L; 11% had Plt &lt;50×10<sup>9</sup>/L. Stage IV disease rates were ROMI 65%, PBO 55%. Most (75%) patients completed study drug; 3% discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). The primary endpoint was achieved in 92/109 (84%) patients receiving ROMI vs 20/56 (36%) receiving PBO (odds ratio 10.2; 95% CI 4.6-22.5; P&lt;0.001). Median (range) Plt nadirs were ROMI 87 (14–167)×10<sup>9</sup>/L, PBO 58 (22–95)×10<sup>9</sup>/L; P=0.005. For those with Plt responses (ROMI 97%, PBO 77%), median (95% CI) time to first Plt response was ROMI 1.1 (not estimable) weeks, PBO 2.1 (1.1-3.0) weeks; P&lt;0.001. Treatment-related (TR) AE rates were ROMI: 12%, PBO: 7%, most frequently nausea (2%, 2%) and headache (2%, 0%). TR serious AEs and TRAEs leading to death or discontinuation of study drug or chemotherapy were not observed in either arm. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this first global phase 3 RCT of ROMI vs PBO for CIT, ROMI was well tolerated and efficacious in the treatment and prevention of CIT in GI cancers. These results are potentially practice-changing for a common serious condition encountered routinely in clinical practice worldwide that prevents delivery of on-time, full-dose anticancer therapy. Final results from long-term follow-up will be presented. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03362177"">NCT03362177</a>.",Symptom Science and Palliative Care,NCT03362177

<b>Background:</b> KEYNOTE-564 (NCT03142334) established pembro monotherapy as the first adjuvant regimen to significantly improve both disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) vs placebo (pbo) after surgery for participants (pts) with ccRCC at increased risk of recurrence. We present results from the fourth prespecified interim analysis with a minimum follow-up of 5 yrs. <b>Methods:</b> KEYNOTE-564 is a randomized, double-blind, pbo-controlled, phase 3 study, which enrolled adults with ccRCC with intermediate-high (pT2 Gr 4 or sarcomatoid, or pT3 any Gr, N0 M0) or high (pT4 any Gr, N0 M0, or any pT and Gr, N+ M0) risk of recurrence or M1 with no evidence of disease (NED) who had nephrectomy and/or metastasectomy ≤12 wks prior to 1:1 randomization to pembro 200 mg or pbo IV Q3W. Treatment continued for ~1 yr (17 cycles) or until recurrence, intolerable AEs, or physician decision to discontinue treatment. The primary endpoint was DFS by investigator; the key secondary endpoint was OS. The study met its DFS and OS objectives at earlier analyses; thus, no subsequent formal statistical testing occurred. AEs were collected for 30-90 days after treatment cessation depending on severity, with serious treatment-related AEs collected regardless of timing. <b>Results:</b> A total of 994 pts were randomized to pembro (n = 496) or pbo (n = 498). The median follow-up time to data cutoff date of 25 Sept 2024 was 69.5 mo (range, 60.2−86.9). All pts completed or discontinued study treatment ≥3 years earlier. 188 DFS events in the pembro group and 241 in the pbo group had occurred. Median DFS was not reached (NR) vs 68.3 mo, respectively (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59−0.86); estimated DFS rate at 5 yrs was 60.9% vs 52.2%. 68 OS events in the pembro group and 99 in the pbo group had occurred. Median OS was NR in both arms (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48−0.90); estimated OS rate at 5 yrs was 87.7% vs 82.3%, respectively. DFS and OS outcomes were consistent across key subgroups, including by prespecified risk and sarcomatoid features (Table). No new serious treatment-related AEs have been reported for ≥3 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> With ≥5 yrs of follow-up, the benefits observed with adjuvant pembro vs pbo are consistent with prior analyses, including in all subgroups. No new serious treatment-related safety signals occurred. Adjuvant pembro remains a standard-of-care option for patients with ccRCC at increased risk of recurrence. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03142334"">NCT03142334</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-492284-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-492284-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap"" tabindex=""0""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left"" rowspan=""2""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"" rowspan=""2"">All pts</th><th colspan=""3"" data-type=""border-bottom""><span>Prespecified risk subgroups</span></th><th colspan=""2"" data-type=""border-bottom""><span>Sarcomatoid features</span></th></tr><tr><th data-type=""row-heading"">Intermediate-high</th><th>High</th><th>M1 NED</th><th>Present</th><th>Absent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">N</td><td>994</td><td>855</td><td>77</td><td>57</td><td>111</td><td>829</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">DFS events</td><td>429</td><td>342</td><td>49</td><td>37</td><td>59</td><td>339</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">DFS HR<br/>(95% CI)</td><td>0.71<br/>(0.59−0.86)</td><td>0.75<br/> (0.61−0.93)</td><td>0.61<br/>(0.35−1.08)</td><td>0.48<br/>(0.25−0.92)</td><td>0.56<br/>(0.33−0.96)</td><td>0.75<br/>(0.60−0.92)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">OS events</td><td>167</td><td>131</td><td>22</td><td>13</td><td>23</td><td>130</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">OS HR<br/>(95% CI)</td><td>0.66<br/>(0.48−0.90)</td><td>0.65<br/>(0.46−0.92)</td><td>0.86<br/>(0.37−1.98)</td><td>0.36<br/>(0.11−1.18)</td><td>0.67<br/>(0.29−1.56)</td><td>0.64<br/>(0.45−0.91)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-492284-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignancy with median survival of approximately 2 years from initial diagnosis and 9 months after first progression. Effective treatments in the recurrent setting following upfront chemoradiation and adjuvant temozolomide are limited. The transmembrane glycoprotein B7H3 is over-expressed in GBM and chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting B7H3 (B7H3-CART) have shown activity in several preclinical cancer models. Intracranial delivery of B7H3-CART may optimize targeting the immune response to the tumor microenvironment while limiting systemic toxicity. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a single-arm phase 1 study in patients with recurrent GBM undergoing repeat resection. B7H3-CART was administered via intratumoral and intraventricular Ommaya reservoirs monthly for a planned 6 months or until confirmed disease progression. When possible per investigator discretion, the dose was divided evenly between the two reservoirs. The primary endpoints were safety and manufacturing feasibility, with secondary endpoints focused on preliminary efficacy. Dose escalation was planned according to a standard 3+3 design (dose level 1: 10x10<sup>6 </sup>cells; level 4 (max): 100x10<sup>6</sup>). Adverse events within 28 days of first dose and at least possibly related to B7H3-CART were considered dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) if meeting additional criteria: any grade 5 toxicity, grade 4 cytokine release syndrome, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia lasting &gt; 14 days, or any non-hematologic grade 3 toxicity lasting &gt; 72 hours. Neurotoxicity was considered a DLT if grade 4 for &gt; 96 hours or new-onset grade 3 for &gt; 28 days. Serial CSF and serum samples were collected for translational studies to determine immune cell kinetics and the mechanisms of activity and resistance. <b>Results:</b> Eleven patients were enrolled, underwent apheresis, and had B7H3-CART successfully manufactured. Nine received at least one dose of B7H3-CART and were evaluable in the dose escalation cohort. One patient in dose level 2 (25x10<sup>6</sup> cells) experienced a DLT (grade 3 hypertension). No additional DLTs were observed in this dose level after expansion to 6 patients, and the recommended phase 2 dose was established at 25x10<sup>6</sup> cells. Toxicity otherwise has been primarily related to tumor inflammation-associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), observed after 29 of 36 infusions (81%), and managed acutely with anakinra and dexamethasone. The median overall survival (mOS) from date of enrollment for patients receiving at least one dose of B7H3-CART is 14.6 months (95% CI: 2.3 - 26.8 months). One patient is currently receiving B7H3-CART and 4 others are being clinically followed up to 22 months from enrollment. <b>Conclusions:</b> Intracranial administration of B7H3-CART in recurrent GBM is technically feasible and safe. TIAN was common but manageable and reversible with immunomodulators. Correlative analyses on surgical tissue, CSF, and serum are ongoing. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05474378"">NCT05474378</a>.",Central Nervous System Tumors,NCT05474378

<b>Background:</b> Standard of care for MIBC is radical cystectomy (RC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT), but ~50% of patients (pts) are ineligible for/refuse CT and survival for RC alone is dismal. Neoadjuvant Pembro and SG monotherapies showed activity in MIBC within PURE-01 and SURE-01 studies. SURE-02 (NCT05535218) is a phase 2 study of neoadjuvant SG+Pembro and adjuvant Pembro, including a bladder-sparing approach depending on clinical response. We report results of a prespecified interim analysis. <b>Methods:</b> Pts age ≥18 y, ECOG PS 0-1, with histologically confirmed cT2-T4N0M0 MIBC, ineligible/refusing CT, and scheduled for RC received 4 cycles of Pembro 200 mg on D1 and SG 7.5 mg/Kg on D1 and D8, Q3W, followed by postsurgical Pembro x 13 cycles, Q3W. A reTURBT is allowed instead of RC, followed by Pembro x 13 cycles, for pts achieving a clinical complete response (cCR), stringently defined as a negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and no residual viable tumor at reTURBT (ypT0). Primary outcome measure is cCR rate: H0≤30%, H1≥45%. Other outcomes: ypT≤1N0-x rate including pts undergoing RC, safety (CTCAE v.5.0), survival. The total sample size is 48 pts in a 2-stage design, with 23 pts enrolled at first stage (≥7 cCR needed). Decipher Bladder (Veracyte, San Diego, CA) was used for transcriptome-wide analyses of primary TURBT tissue. <b>Results:</b> From 10/23 to 01/25, 40 pts were treated and 31 were efficacy evaluable. 20 (64.5%) had a cT2 stage, 12 (38.7%) had a centrally confirmed variant histology. The cCR-rate was 38.7% (N = 12; 95%CI: 21.8-57.8); all these pts underwent a reTURBT; ypT≤1N0-x rate was 51.6% (N = 16). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse-events occurred in 4 pts (12.9%), 2 dose omissions of SG and one dose delay (1W) were recorded. No SG dose-reduction was needed. cCR varied by molecular subtype. Transcriptome results were available for 23 pts: complete pathologic (ypT0) responses varied by Genomic Subtyping Classifier (GSC) groups with luminal tumors showing higher ypT0 rates vs non-luminal (73 vs 25%, p = 0.04). Similarly, based on Lund subtypes, genomically unstable (GU) tumors had ypT0 response in 67%, vs 57% for urothelial-like, 20% for basal/squamous and 0% for neuroendocrine-like. Higher stromal signature (&gt; median) was associated with non-ypT0 response (p = 0.004), while neither Trop2 (p = 0.15) nor <i>TOP1</i> (p = 0.79) gene expression were associated with ypT0 response. <b>Conclusions:</b> Perioperative SG+Pembro revealed a compelling cCR rate, with a manageable safety profile, allowing a bladder preservation in ~40% of pts. Pre-treatment molecular biomarker analyses suggest a unique tumor profile associated with cCR. Overall, SURE-02 interim results support the completion of study accrual and further investigation of SG+Pembro in pts with MIBC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05535218"">NCT05535218</a>.",Genitourinary Cancer—Kidney and Bladder,NCT05535218

<b>Background:</b> Patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) rectal cancer account for a high proportion with poor response to immunotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the neoadjuvant therapy with mFOLFOXIRI plus camrelizumab (PD-1 antibody) and bevacizumab for MSS locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and to explore its possible mechanisms. <b>Methods:</b> neoFOLCAB was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study done at Peking University Shougang Hospital. The trial recruited 32 patients with MSS-LARC aged between 18 and 70 years old. The enrolled patients received intravenous administration of carfilzomib, bevacizumab, and mFOLFOXIRI for 4-6 cycles. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological and clinical complete response (cCR). Tumor tissues were subjected to NGS. Peripheral blood was collected for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection. The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100054182). The submission was approved by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee of Peking University Shougang Hospital. <b>Results:</b> Between February 24, 2022, and August 9, 2024, 32 patients were enrolled, with 3 patients being excluded from the final analysis due to reasons unrelated to the study. Among the patients included, 9 were female (31%) and 20 were male (69%). The median follow-up time was 17.7 months (IQR 3.9 to 32.9 months). cCR was achieved in 10 patients (34.5%; 95% CI 16% to 53%), with 7 of them adopting the watch and wait strategy. Surgical treatment was performed in 58.6% of the patients (17 cases), and 6 patients (35.3%; 95% CI 12% to 68%) achieved pathological complete response (pCR). 13 cases (44.8%; 95% CI 26% to 64%) achieved complete response (CR). The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) was 37.9%. The number of ctDNA mutations (P &lt; 0.001), mutation abundance (P &lt; 0.001), and mutation level (P &lt; 0.001) all decreased with therapeutic response. Tumors in CR patients showed high infiltration levels of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells after treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> The combination of camrelizumab and bevacizumab with chemotherapy showed excellent efficacy as a neoadjuvant therapy for patients with MSS LARC with manageable treatment-related toxicity. The ctDNA indicators can serve as biomarkers for predicting the efficacy and prognosis of neoadjuvant therapy. <a>Clinical trial information: ChiCTR2100054182</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-497280-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-497280-001""><figcaption>Postoperative pathologic findings.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Pathologic Finding</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Patients</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Surgical resection margins (R0/R1/R2)</td><td><b>N=18</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> R0<br/>R1/R2</td><td>18 (100%)<br/>0 (0%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathologic risk group</td><td><b>N=18</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> Very low<br/>Low<br/>Intermediate<br/>High<br/>Very high</td><td>10 (55.6%)<br/>1 (5.6%)<br/>0 (0%)<br/>0 (0%)<br/>7 (38.8%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">pTRG Grade</td><td><b>N=18</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> 0<br/>1<br/>2<br/>3</td><td>6 (33.3%)<br/>3 (16.7%)<br/>6 (33.3%)<br/>3 (16.7%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathologic T stage, n (%)</td><td><b>N=18</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> T0<br/>Tis<br/>T1<br/>T2<br/>T3<br/>T4</td><td>6 (33.2%)<br/>1 (5.6%)<br/>0 (0%)<br/>5 (27.8%)<br/>5 (27.8%)<br/>1 (5.6%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Pathologic N stage, n (%)</td><td><b>N=18</b></td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> N0<br/>N1<br/>N2</td><td>13 (72.2%)<br/>3 (16.7%)<br/>2 (11.1%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-497280-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> The ASTRRA trial previously demonstrated that adding ovarian function suppression (OFS) to tamoxifen (TAM) showed consistent disease free survival (DFS) benefit at 8-yr follow-up analysis in premenopausal women with hormone-receptor (HR)–positive breast cancer who remain premenopausal or resume menstruation after chemotherapy. Here, we aimed to update the survival outcomes and identify patients most likely to benefit from OFS to tailor clinical decision-making. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,282 premenopausal women were randomized 1:1 to receive either 5 years of TAM alone (TAM-only) or 5 years of TAM with OFS for 2 years (TAM + OFS). The primary endpoint was DFS, and the secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS). For the HER2-negative cohort, a composite risk score (range: 0–5) for breast cancer-free interval (BCFI) was calculated based on tumor size, nodal status, and tumor grade using a Cox regression model. The impact of OFS was analyzed by composite risk score and stratified by age. The events for BCFI were defined as local, regional, or distant recurrence; invasive contralateral breast cancer; or death resulting from breast cancer as the first event. <b>Results:</b> With a median follow-up of 117.6 months, the 10-year DFS rate was 83.7% in the TAM + OFS group compared to 75.9% in the TAM-only group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87). Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in 10-year OS: 94.6% in the TAM + OFS vs. 93.2% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.50-1.27). In the 776 patients with HER2-negative breast cancer, there were no significant differences in the distribution of age group (<i>P</i> = .320), tumor size (<i>P</i> = .572), lymph node status (<i>P</i> = .577), or histologic grade (<i>P</i> = .249) between TAM + OFS and TAM-only groups. Worse 10-year BCFI was significantly associated with younger age ( &lt; 40 vs. 40-45 years, <i>P</i> = .026), larger tumor size (≥ 2cm vs. &lt; 2cm, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), lymph node positivity (positive vs. negative, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and aggressive histologic grade (III vs. II vs. I, <i>P</i> = .006), respectively. Among patients with a high composite risk score (4–5, n = 282, 36.3% of the HER2-negative cohort), the 10-year BCFI was significantly improved with OFS: 76.6% in the TAM + OFS group vs. 65.7% in the TAM-only group (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.98). This benefit was particularly pronounced in patients aged 40–45 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> We demonstrated the consistent benefit of adding OFS for 2 years to TAM in improving 10-year DFS. In patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer and a high composite risk score, the addition of TAM plus OFS resulted in a 10.9% improvement in the 10-year BCFI, suggesting this approach may be beneficial, especially for those aged 40-45 years. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00912548"">NCT00912548</a>.",Breast Cancer—Local/Regional/Adjuvant,NCT00912548

<b>Background:</b> First-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab (NIVO+IPI) provided substantial long-term survival benefits over sunitinib (SUN) in patients (pts) with advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC) in the CheckMate 214 trial. We now report final efficacy and safety data in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk. <b>Methods:</b> Pts with clear cell aRCC were randomized 1:1 to NIVO 3 mg/kg + IPI 1 mg/kg Q3W×4 then NIVO (3 mg/kg or 240 mg Q2W or 480 mg Q4W); or SUN 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. Efficacy endpoints included overall survival (OS), and independent radiology review committee (IRRC)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in intermediate/poor-risk (I/P; primary), ITT (secondary), and favorable-risk (FAV; exploratory) pts. Response was assessed using RECIST v1.1. <b>Results:</b> With 9 years median follow-up, OS was improved with NIVO+IPI vs SUN in ITT (HR 0.71) and I/P (HR 0.69) pts. The probability of OS at 108 months was 31% vs 20% in ITT pts and 30% vs 19% in I/P pts, respectively. In pts with FAV risk, the HR for OS improved from 1.45 at first report (Motzer <i>NEJM</i> 2018) to 0.80 at 9 years, showing a delayed benefit with NIVO+IPI vs SUN. OS probabilities at 108 months were 35% vs 22% in FAV pts, respectively (Table). The probability of PFS at 96 months with NIVO+IPI vs SUN was 23% vs 9% in ITT pts, 25% vs 9% in I/P pts, and 13% vs 11% in FAV pts. The probability of remaining in response through 96 months with NIVO+IPI vs SUN was 48% vs 19% in ITT pts, 50% vs 23% in I/P pts, and 36% vs not available (NA) in FAV pts. No new treatment-related deaths occurred in either arm. Additional subgroup analyses will be presented. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the longest and final phase 3 follow-up (9 years) of a first-line checkpoint inhibitor combination in aRCC, milestone rates of OS and PFS and durable response remained higher with NIVO+IPI vs SUN. No new safety signals emerged. NIVO+IPI remains a standard first-line option in aRCC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02231749"">NCT02231749</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-491108-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-491108-001""><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">ITT</th><td data-type=""border-bottom""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">I/P</th><td data-type=""border-bottom""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">FAV</th><td data-type=""border-bottom""> </td></tr><tr><th data-type=""row-heading"">Arm; n</th><th>NIVO+IPI; 550</th><th>SUN; 546</th><th>NIVO+IPI; 425</th><th>SUN; 422</th><th>NIVO+IPI; 125</th><th>SUN; 124</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mOS (95% CI), mo</td><td>53 (46–64)</td><td>38 (32–44)</td><td>47 (35–56)</td><td>26 (22–33)</td><td>78 (65–92)</td><td>67 (56–80)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">108-mo OS probabilities (95% CI), %</td><td>31 (27–35)</td><td>20 (16–23)</td><td>30 (26–35)</td><td>19 (15–23)</td><td>35 (27–44)</td><td>22 (15–30)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mPFS (95% CI), mo</td><td>12 (10–16)</td><td>12 (10–15)</td><td>12 (9–17)</td><td>9 (7–11)</td><td>13 (10–18)</td><td>29 (23–43)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">96-mo<sup>a</sup> PFS probabilities (95% CI), %</td><td>23 (18–27)</td><td>9 (5–15)</td><td>25 (20–31)</td><td>9 (4–15)</td><td>13 (6–22)</td><td>11 (3–27)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ORR per IRRC (95% CI); CR, %</td><td>39 (35–44); 12</td><td>33 (29–37); 3</td><td>42 (38–47); 12</td><td>27 (23–32); 3</td><td>30 (22–38); 13</td><td>52 (43–61); 6</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mDOR (95% CI), mo</td><td>76 (59–NE)</td><td>25 (20–33)</td><td>83 (54–NE)</td><td>20 (16–26)</td><td>61 (23–NE)</td><td>33 (25–51)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">96-mo<sup>a</sup> DOR probabilities (95% CI), %</td><td>48 (39–55)</td><td>19 (10–31)</td><td>50 (41–58)</td><td>23 (13–36)</td><td>36 (17–56)</td><td>NA<sup>b</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-491108-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-491108-001-1"" role=""paragraph""><sup>a</sup>96-mo probabilities reported due to small numbers of pts at risk at 108 mo.</div></div><div role=""doc-footnote""><sup>b</sup>No pts remain at risk.</div><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-491108-001-2"" role=""paragraph"">CR, complete response; DOR, duration of response; m, median; NE, not estimable.</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> The PRANCIS model has been shown to be robust for identifying patients with recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) who are at high risk of treatment-related adverse events from re-irradiation (reRT). Here, we investigate the efficacy of combination doublet gemcitabine-cisplatin (GP) and PD-1 inhibitor (Toripalimab) to down-classify PRANCIS high risk (&gt;252) to low-risk post-3 cycles of treatment, and the survival outcomes of these patients. For patients who converted to low-risk, reRT may be considered (NCT03930498). <b>Methods:</b> Eligibility criteria included diagnosed as local ± regional recurrence after ≥1 year of radical treatment, not suitable for surgery, histologic or clinically diagnosis of NPC, stage rII-IVa (AJCC/UICC 8th), PRANCIS model &gt; 252 points. All patients received 3 cycles of GP + PD-1 inhibitor, then received reRT (GTV, 60-66Gy, 1.8-2.0Gy/f) plus PD-1 inhibitor if got CR/PR (reRT group), or received another 3 cycles of GP+PD-1 inhibitor if got SD (no reRT group), finally all got 4 cycles of PD-1 inhibitor maintenance. Primary end point was 2-year overall survival (OS). <b>Results:</b> Between Mar 2020 to Nov 2023, 68 high-risk patients were recruited (Table 1). After 3 cycles of GP + PD-1 inhibitor, 44 (64.7%) patients got PR (34 down-classify to low-risk and 10 still high-risk) and received full-course reRT, 22 (32.4%) got SD (all high-risk) and kept receiving GP + PD-1 inhibitor, and 2 (2.9%) could not be evaluated due to 1 died of COVID-19 and 1 withdrew after 2 cycles of treatment. 56 (82.4%) patients finished the scheduled treatment, and 12 discontinued chemo-immunotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 32.7 months, the 2-year OS of whole cohort was 67.2%, and 73.8% vs 51.2% (<i><i>P</i></i> = 0.019) in reRT group vs no reRT group. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of whole cohort was 47.9%, and 61.0% vs 24.3% (<i><i>P</i></i> &lt; 0.0001) in reRT group vs no reRT group. The most common ≥grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (30.9%), lymphopenia (22.1%), and xerostomia (16.2%). The incidences of grade 3 nasopharyngeal necrosis was 5.9%.

<b>Background:</b> Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment has entered the era of immunotherapy, the optimal treatment model for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) remains unclear. This trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding toripalimab to induction chemotherapy (IC) in patients with LANPC. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with LANPC (T4NanyM0 or TanyN2/N3M0, AJCC 8th edition) were enrolled at 8 centers across China and randomized (1:1) into two arms: the standard arm (gemcitabine and cisplatin IC followed by cisplatin concurrent chemoradiotherapy [CCRT]) and the toripalimab arm (toripalimab plus IC followed by CCRT). Both arms received intravenous gemcitabine (1g/m²) on days 1 and 8, and cisplatin (80 mg/m²) on day 1, every 3 weeks for 3 cycles, followed by standard CCRT (cisplatin 100 mg/m² every 3 weeks for 3 cycles). In the toripalimab arm, patients also received intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) on day 1 every 3 weeks for 3 induction cycles. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS). Secondary endpoints included complete response (CR) rate after neoadjuvant treatment, locoregional failure-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Response evaluation was conducted according to RECIST 1.1, and adverse events (AEs) were assessed by CTCAE v5.0. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05340270), and follow-up is ongoing. <b>Results:</b> Between July 2022 and March 2024, 150 patients (mean age 47 years, 72% male) were randomized to the toripalimab arm (n = 75) and the standard arm (n = 75). As of November 30, 2024, the median follow-up duration was 23.4 months, and 15 patients had reached the primary endpoint. Long-term efficacy data are still awaited. The CR rate after neoadjuvant treatment was 36.0% (27 of 75) in the toripalimab arm and 13.3% (10 of 75) in the standard arm (<i><i>P</i></i>= 0.001). The overall response rate (ORR) after neoadjuvant treatment was 94.7% (71 of 75) in the toripalimab arm and 85.3% (64 of 75) in the standard arm (<i><i>P</i></i>= 0.042). Grade 3-4 acute treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) occurred in 50 (66.7%) patients in the toripalimab arm and46 (61.3%) patients in the standard arm (<i><i>P</i></i>= 0.496), with immune-related AEs (irAEs) reported in 5 (6.7%) patients in the toripalimab arm and none (0.0%) in the standard arm (<i><i>P</i></i>= 0.058). All grade 3-4 irAEs were manifested as rashes and pruritus. <b>Conclusions:</b> Adding toripalimab to standard IC followed by CCRT resulted in a superior CR rate and ORR compared to IC-CCRT alone, with manageable toxicity profiles in patients with LANPC. Further follow-up is needed to confirm long-term efficacy, and this combination may offer an optimal, cost-effective therapeutic model for LANPC. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05340270"">NCT05340270</a>.",Head and Neck Cancer,NCT05340270

<b>Background:</b> Event-free survival for patients in the highest risk groups of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) remains poor. The COG ARST0431 study showed that dose-intensified chemotherapy benefits a subset of metastatic RMS patients. This phase Ib trial defined the safety profile, highest tested dose (HTD), and recommended phase 2 dose for dose intense irinotecan on days 8-12 combined with the standard European 3-weekly Ifosfamide, Vincristine, Actinomycin D (IVA) regimen within the European <i>paediatric</i> Soft tissue sarcoma Study Group (E<i>p</i>SSG) Frontline and Relapsed Rhabdomyosarcoma (FaR-RMS) study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04625907). <b>Methods:</b> Patients aged &gt;1 to ≤25 years with Very High Risk (VHR) RMS (FOXO1 fusion-positive, node-positive, Subgroup G and metastatic, Subgroup H) were included in designated Phase I centres. Participants received IVA (Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m² on days 1–2; vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 and on day 15 in cycle 1 and 2 only; actinomycin D 1.5 mg/m2 on day 1 with irinotecan on days 8–12. The irinotecan starting dose was 20 mg/m²/day, with dose escalation/de-escalation to a maximum of 50mg/m2/day utilising a rolling six design. The Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) period was defined as up to 28 days after the start of cycle 2. All Adverse events (AEs) were assessed against the DLT definition during this time. DLTs included Grade 3 diarrhoea, enterocolitis, ileus or oral mucositis persisting &gt; 3 days; Grade 4 diarrhoea; neutropenia or thrombocytopenia delaying treatment &gt; 7 days; Grade 3/4 toxicities resulting in treatment discontinuation, or any Grade 5 toxicity (death) related to trial treatment. First radiological response assessment was after cycle 3 I<sub>R</sub>IVA. <b>Results:</b> A total of 22 patients (Subgroup G, 3; Subgroup H, 19) were enrolled across 4 dose levels (20 mg/m2/day (n = 5); 30 mg/m2/day (n = 5); 40 mg/m2/day (n = 6); 50 mg/m2/day (n = 6)). Median age was 13.4 years; interquartile range, 5.2-16.3 years. All patients were evaluable for DLTs. One DLT of Grade 3 enterocolitis was observed at dose level 50 mg/m². The HTD and RP2D of irinotecan in combination with IVA were established as 50 mg/m²/day. The most common Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in &gt; 30% of patients, during the first 3 treatment cycles were: febrile neutropenia 13 (59.1%), neutropenia 13 (59.1%); leukopenia 12 (54.5%); anaemia 10 (45.5%), and lymphopenia 7 (31.8%). The overall Response Rate (Complete or Partial Response) at first assessment was 81.8% (18/22). <b>Conclusions:</b> The RP2D for irinotecan on days 8-12 within I<sub>R</sub>IVA was identified as 50 mg/m²/day. The intensified I<sub>R</sub>IVA regimen is under evaluation in randomised questions, in adults and children with paediatric-type RMS, within the FaR-RMS trial in High Risk patients (IVA vs I<sub>R</sub>IVA) and VHR patients (IVA plus doxorubicin vs I<sub>R</sub>IVA). <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04625907"">NCT04625907</a>.",Pediatric Oncology,NCT04625907

<b>Background:</b> Pembrolizumab (pembro) with chemotherapy has shown survival benefit in PD-L1+ (CPS10+) mTNBC, but many responses are not durable, and patients with PD-L1 negative/low tumors do not benefit from the combination. Data from GeparNuevo and TONIC suggest that induction therapy can remodel the tumor immune environment and improve responses. We have conducted a trial with two run-in cohorts and mandatory serial tissue and blood collections in 50 mTNBC patients, comparing pembro vs. nab-paclitaxel (nab-P). <b>Methods:</b> Single-arm, single institution phase II study (NCT02752685) to evaluate safety and clinical activity of nab-P+pembro in PD-L1 unselected mTNBC, 0-2 prior lines of chemotherapy allowed. Patients (n = 50) were enrolled sequentially into two cohorts: chemotherapy run-in (cTNBC, nab-P before nab-P+pembro) and immunotherapy run-in (iTNBC, pembro before nab-P+pembro). Serial tumor biopsies assessed by IHC (Dako 22C3), quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qMIF), and gene expression (NanoString). Overall response rates assessed using irRECIST. Tumoral T- and myeloid-cell phenotypes, peripheral lymphocyte-to-neutrophil ratio (LNR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were correlated with overall response rate (ORR) and survival outcomes. <b>Results:</b> 50 patients enrolled and completed treatment, for 80% of patients: treatment was 1L for metastatic disease. Median follow-up is 19.9 months, clinical results for cTNBC and iTNBC cohorts shown in table. Across both cohorts higher LNR was associated with improved OS (<i>R</i>= 0.37, <i>p</i>= 0.0075), conversely, higher MLR was associated with poorer OS (<i>R</i>= -0.46, <i>p</i>= 0.00087). Tumor immune cell subpopulations showed no significant differences between iTNBC and cTNBC at baseline. Analyses of on-treatment samples will be presented at the meeting. PD-L1 expression, while not different at baseline, remained unchanged in cTNBC but increased significantly in iTNBC (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.02), possibly reflecting pembrolizumab-driven immune modulation. With the caveat of comparing sequential cohorts, the iTNBC cohort showed a trend for higher ORR (47% vs. 23%, <i>p</i>= 0.08) and longer median PFS (8.4 vs. 5.5 months, HR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.37-1.24), with significantly longer OS (25.8 vs. 18 months, HR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.26-0.98, p = 0.043) compared to cTNBC. <b>Conclusions:</b> Timing of pembro administration may influence PD-L1 expression and clinical outcomes in mTNBC. We show that the immunotherapy run-in strategy converts more PD-L1-negative/low into PD-L1-positive tumors, possibly rendering more patients eligible for chemoimmunotherapy and improving outcomes. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02752685"">NCT02752685</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open Unlabeled table 1 in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-503638-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-503638-001""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">cTNBC (n=30)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">iTNBC (n=20)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">PD-L1 CPS &gt;/=10</td><td>5/23 (22%)</td><td>2/16 (12%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">PD-L1 CPS conversion (CPS&lt;10 to CPS&gt;/=10)</td><td>2/14 (14%)</td><td>4/13 (31%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Confirmed ORR (CR+PR)</td><td>7/30 (23%)</td><td>9/19 (47%)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mPFS (months)</td><td>5.5</td><td>8.4</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mOS (months)</td><td>18.0</td><td>25.8</td></tr></tbody></table></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Pain and deterioration in quality of life (QoL) are among the most common and problematic symptoms reported by patients with late-stage lung cancer. Thus, <i>cannabis sativa</i> extract has been identified as a potencial adjuctive therapy for enhancing QoL and managing symptoms, including oncology pain. Objective: The aim is to assess pain management and quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer using <i>cannabis sativa</i> extract. <b>Methods:</b> A randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial was conducted, which included patients, which included patients with locally advanced or metastatic lung confirmed by histopathology. The participants were subdivided into two groups of 20 patients each, with 1:1 allocation ratio. The primary outcome was pain control, measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain. The secondary outcomes included quality of life, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and its specific module for lung cancer (QLQ-LC13). The <i>cannabis sativa</i> extract administration protocol involved dose escalation, starting at 10mg/day, with titration every 5 days until the patients reached their goals or the maximum dose of 100mg/day. The questionnaires and the VAS scale were applied every 21 days from T1 to T5. Continuous variables were analyzed using the paired t-test or signed-rank test, depending on the date distribution. <b>Results:</b> The difference in mean pain scores (measured using the EVA tool) was greater in the CBD group compared to the placebo group between periods T1 and T5 (5.0 vs 3.7) (Table1). Similarly, the difference in mean pain scores, as measured using the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale (47.2 vs 35.7), favored the CBD group. Regarding the quality of life analysis, in the overall assessment date were not statistically significant, however difference was observed in the levels of insomnia (p-value 0.01) and dyspnea (p-value 0.02) between patients in the CBD and placebo groups, with results favoring the CBD group. <b>Conclusion:</b> The <i>cannabis sativa</i> extract may be considered an adjuvant in the management of pain and quality of life in patients with metastatic lung cancer and locally advanced. <a>Clinical trial information: 6.036.463</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-486090-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-486090-001""><figcaption>Pain control analysis by the EVA scale between times.</figcaption><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><td data-type=""border-bottom align-left""> </td><th data-type=""border-bottom"">T1</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">T3</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">T5</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading""> </td><td>Mean (SD)</td><td>Mean (SD)</td><td>Mean (SD)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">CBD group</td><td>7.2 (2.1)</td><td>3.3 (2.6)</td><td>2.2 (2.4)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Placebo group</td><td>7.4 (1.8)</td><td>3.7 (3.1)</td><td>3.7 (3.3)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-486090-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">Average EVA scale scores by group and time.</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Urinary tract squamous cell carcinoma (UTSCC) is a rare disease, comprising approximately 3% of histological subtypes from the bladder and urinary tract. Limited data exist to support treatment choices and no prospective trials, dedicated specifically to this histology, have been undertaken to evaluate immunotherapy. Prior data indicate high PD-L1 expression and tumour immune cell infiltration in a proportion of UTSCC cases. We report the Stage 1 outcome for the AURORA clinical trial, which tested atezolizumab immunotherapy for patients with incurable UTSCC. <b>Methods:</b> Patients had progressive, measurable, UTSCC and ECOG performance status 0-2. Mixed histology was permitted but with no urothelial carcinoma component. One prior line of systemic chemotherapy was permitted for advanced disease but no prior immunotherapy. Treatment comprised atezolizumab (1680 mg IV, q28d) until disease progression and for up to one year if tolerated. The primary endpoint was best overall objective response rate (ORR; RECIST v1.1) with a Simon 2 stage statistical design, and planned, independent, interim efficacy review after 19 patients were assessable for response (without a recruitment pause). If ≥4 of the first 19 patients (Stage 1) achieved an objective response (confirmed partial or complete response), then recruitment would continue through Stage 2, where ≥8 responses in 33 patients were required to indicate further investigation was warranted (p1 = 15%, p2 = 35%, 1-sided alpha = 0.1, power = 90%). Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, safety and tolerability (CTCAEv5). <b>Results:</b> 3 of the first 19 recruited patients achieved an objective response (15.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 - 39.6; 3 partial and no complete responses) leading the Independent Data Monitoring Committee to recommend closure to recruitment. 3 further patients (15.8%) achieved a best response of stable disease. With a median duration of follow up of 10.1 months (95% CI 3.5 - not calculated), 17 PFS events have occurred, with a median PFS of 3.0 months (95% CI 1.4 - 3.8). 13 patients have died, with a median OS of 5.2 months (95% CI 2.7 - 8.5). Duration of objective response was 8.4 months in one patient and is ongoing in the other 2 responding patients. Adverse events were predominantly disease related. Atezolizumab was well tolerated with no new safety signals observed relating to this treatment. <b>Conclusions:</b> The objective response rate, and other efficacy endpoints, did not meet protocol defined thresholds for activity and so do not support further development of atezolizumab immunotherapy as a monotherapy for unselected patients with UTSCC. Translational endpoint analyses are ongoing. <a>Clinical trial information: ISRCTN83474167</a>.",Genitourinary Cancer—Kidney and Bladder,ISRCTN83474167

<b>Background:</b> The current standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer is chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) . For locally advanced colon cancer, neoadjuvant FOLFOX is also an option. In the era of immunotherapy, several studies have explored the efficacy of CRT combined with immunotherapy treatment. However, no studies have yet investigated the efficacy and safety of chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy in locally advanced colorectal cancer. We aim to explore the efficacy of mFOLFOXIRI with or without cadonilimab (AK104) compared to mFOLFOX6 neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced colorectal cancer (LACRC). <b>Methods:</b> OPTICAL-2 was a randomized, phase II trial in patients with II/III rectal ancer and locally advanced colon cancer (T3 ≥5 mm or T4). Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1 ) to 3 groups: preoperative mFOLFOXIRI plus AK104 for 6 cycles or mFOLFOXIRI for 6 cycles, or mFOLFOX6 alone for 6 cycles, followed by TME and adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was pCR rate in mITT population, and the secondary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR) rate, 3-year disease-free survival, overall survival and safety. <b>Results:</b> From July 2023 to August 2024, 123 patients with LACRC were enrolled, with 41 patients in each group, including 22 colon cancer and 101 rectal cancer. As the data cutoff, 121 patients had underwent surgery (41 in mFOLFOXIRI plus AK104, 39 in mFOLFOXIRI group and 41 in mFOLFOX6 group). Preoperative radiotherapy was added after induction treatment in 5 (12.2%), 4 (9.7%) and 3 (7.3%) patients among the 3 groups. In the mITT analysis, the pCR rate was 26.8% vs. 15.4% vs. 9.8% among the 3 groups, respectively. The downstaging (ypStage 0 to 1) was 65.9%, 46.2% and 41.5%, respectively. The MPR rate was 68.3%, 48.7% and 43.9%, respectively. While in the PP analysis (completed 6 cycles of preoperative treatment), the pCR rates were 30.6%, 17.1%, and 10.8%, respectively. The downstaging was 63.8%, 45.7% and 37.8%, respectively. Safety assessments was generally well-tolerated. <b>Conclusions:</b> mFOLFOXIRI with AK104 demonstrated a higher pCR rate, downstaging rate and MPR rtae compared with FOLFOX chemotherapy in patients with LACRC. This study suggests that the combination of Intensified chemotherapy and dual immunotherapy may be a promising approach for improving treatment outcomes. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05571644"">NCT05571644</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-496966-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-496966-001""><figcaption>Pathologic outcome and surgical parameters.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Characteristics</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">mFOLFOXIRI+AK104 (A)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">mFOLFOXIRI (B)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">mFOLFOX6 (C)</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">P1 (A vs. C)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">mITT analysis</td><td>n=41</td><td>n=39</td><td>n=41</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">pCR</td><td>11 (26.83%)</td><td>6 (15.38%)</td><td>4(9.76%)</td><td>0.046</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ypStage 0-I</td><td>27 (65.9%)</td><td>18 (46.2%)</td><td>17 (41.5%)</td><td>0.026</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">MPR</td><td>28 (68.3%)</td><td>19 (48.7%)</td><td>18 (43.9%)</td><td>0.026</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">PP analysis</td><td>n=36</td><td>n=35</td><td>n=37</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">pCR</td><td>11 (30.6%)</td><td>6 (17.1%)</td><td>4 (10.8%)</td><td>0.036</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">ypStage 0-I</td><td>23 (63.8%)</td><td>16 (45.7%)</td><td>14 (37.8%)</td><td>0.026</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-496966-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div><div class=""notes""><div role=""doc-footnote""><div id=""TF-496966-001-1"" role=""paragraph"">Footnote: pCR, pathological complete response; MPR, major pathological response.</div></div></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> OBX-115 TIL are engineered to express mbIL15 regulated by the FDA-approved small-molecule drug acetazolamide (ACZ), abrogating the need for toxic high-dose IL2 after TIL infusion. Single-center phase 1 data (NCT05470283) demonstrated differentiated early safety (Amaria ASCO 2024). We report the first data evaluating OBX-115 in pts with advanced melanoma in the multicenter phase 1/2 Agni-01 study (NCT06060613). <b>Methods:</b> This single-arm, open-label study assesses safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the OBX-115 TIL cell therapy regimen in pts with advanced melanoma and NSCLC (Shoushtari AACR 2025). Phase 1 characterizes safety (treatment-emergent adverse events [TEAEs]: AEs ≤30 d after OBX-115 infusion) and tolerability in escalating dose levels of OBX-115 and ACZ to establish a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Phase 2 evaluates efficacy of the regimen at RP2D (RECIST v1.1 per investigator). OBX-115 is manufactured from pt tumor tissue (core needle biopsy or surgical excision) and infused after standard- or low-dose (Cy 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d × 3; Flu 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d × 4) lymphodepletion (LD). No IL2 is administered. Oral ACZ starts day of OBX-115 infusion (QD up to 14 d), and is redosed (QD up to 7 d) every 6 wks after recovery from LD. <b>Results:</b> In phase 1,as of 01 Jan 2025, OBX-115 was successfully manufactured and infused for 11 pts with ICI-resistant advanced melanoma (median study follow-up, 22.3 wks [range, 13.3–52.1]) including 6 treated at RP2D (OBX-115 1–100×10<sup>9</sup> cells, ACZ 500 mg/d). Majority (n = 10) received low-dose LD, including 1 in the outpatient setting. There was no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), treatment-emergent ICU transfer, or treatment-related mortality (TRM). Eight pts had G≥3 nonhematologic TEAEs (events in &gt; 1 pt: hyponatremia, hypokalemia [n = 2 each]). One pt reported 2 OBX-115–related serious AEs, including 1 CRS event (G2) without IL6 elevation (IL6 &lt; 100 pg/mL). Across dose levels (n = 11), confirmed ORR was 36% (4 PR, 5 SD; DCR 82%). For 6 pts receiving RP2D, ORR was 67% (4 PR, 2 SD; DCR 100%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Early data support clinical benefit (RP2D ORR 67%, DCR 100%) of OBX-115regulatableengineeredTIL cell therapy in the absence of IL2, including with outpatient low-dose LD. The safety profile is highly differentiated, without TRM, ICU transfer, or high-grade CRS. ACZ redosing is well-tolerated and offers an opportunity to deepen responses by inducing re-expression of mbIL15 on engrafted OBX-115 TIL, a unique capability among adoptive cell therapies. These attributes may comprehensively address the unmet need in post-ICI advanced melanoma and other cancers, and data support continued investigation of OBX-115 in the ongoing phase 2 portion of the Agni-01 study. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06060613"">NCT06060613</a>.",Melanoma/Skin Cancers,NCT06060613

<b>Background:</b> Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) plays a role in DNA damage repair, and PARP inhibitors can exert anti-tumor efficiency in tumors with homologous recombination repair defection (HRD). Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) plays an important role in cell cycle regulation. Rb is the direct substrate of CDK4/6, and Rb/E2F participates the HR-mediated DNA repair. Therefore, selective CDK4/6 inhibition can theoretically aggravate HRD and hinder DNA repair of tumor cells treated with PARP inhibitors. Combined of CDK4/6 and PARP inhibitors may provide a potential new drug strategy for sarcomas. <b>Methods:</b> FOUNDS is a 2-part, open-label, phase 1/2 study. Key inclusion criteria are: (1) 12-75 years old; (2) Locally advanced or metastatic sarcomas after first-line treatment, with at least one measurable lesion according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patients(pts) will receive fluzoparib (0.1 or 0.15 g po., qd, q4w) and dalpiciclib (0.1, 0.125 or 0.15 g po., qd, d1-21, q4w) continuously until progressive disease (PD) or intolerable toxicity occurred. Part 1 is intended to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) using a i3+3 dose escalation design. Part 2 will examine the safety and efficacy of fluzoparib + dalpiciclib using the method of Confidence Intervals for One Proportion. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate (ORR). <b>Results:</b> In the escalation part, 12 pts (median age 22 years) were included. At the data cut-off (Jun. 10, 2025), the median follow-up time was 7.93 month (95% CI 7.03-8.83). The DCR per RECIST v1.1 is 12.5% including 2 pts who achieved a stable disease. The most common treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs, ≥20%) were leukopenia, neutropenia, etc. 3 pts (25%) had grade ≥3 TRAEs and no drug-related AEs led to death. In Cohort 4, 1 pt experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of grade 3 thrombocytopenia, and the other 1 pt experienced DLT of severe stun. The RP2D was determined as Fluzoparib 0.1g bid. plus Dalpiciclib 0.15g qd, d1-d21, q4w. <b>Conclusions:</b> This novel combination therapy of CDK4/6 inhibitor and PARP inhibitor showed manageable toxicity that could provide a strategy for advanced or metastatic sarcoma. Part 2 to evaluate safety and efficacy is currently recruiting pts. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05952128"">NCT05952128</a>.<div class=""figure-wrap""><button aria-label=""Open undefined in Viewer"" class=""btn btn-dark figure-pop-btn"" data-index=""0"" data-open=""viewer"" data-target=""core-fv-table-498254-001""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-extlink-smooth""></i><span>Open in Viewer</span></button><figure class=""table"" id=""table-498254-001""><figcaption>TRAEs with an incidence of ≥30% and any grade ≥3 TRAEs.</figcaption><div class=""collapsible-wrapper collapsed"" style=""height: 280px;""><div class=""table-wrap""><table><thead><tr><th data-type=""border-bottom align-left"">Cohort</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">1</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">2</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">3</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">4</th><th data-type=""border-bottom"">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Dose every 4 weeks (q4w)<br/>Fluzoparib bid. + Dalpiciclib qd. d1-d21</td><td>0.1g<br/>+0.1g</td><td>0.1g<br/>+0.125g</td><td>0.1g<br/>+0.15g</td><td>0.15g<br/>+0.15g</td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">N</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">TEAEs, n (%)</td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td><td> </td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">All grades</td><td>4(100)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>2(100)</td><td>12(100)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Leukopenia</td><td>3(75)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>10(83)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Neutropenia</td><td>3(75)</td><td>2(67)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>9(75)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Anemia</td><td>1(25)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>3(100)</td><td>2(100)</td><td>7(58)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Vomiting</td><td>2(50)</td><td>2(67)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>6(50)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Thrombocytopenia</td><td>2(50)</td><td>2(67)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>6(50)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Diarrhea</td><td>1(25)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>4(33)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Cough</td><td>1(25)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>2(67)</td><td>0(0)</td><td>4(33)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Fever</td><td>2(50)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>0(0)</td><td>0(0)</td><td>3(25)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Stun</td><td>0(0)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>1(50)</td><td>3(25)</td></tr><tr><td data-type=""row-heading"">Grade ≥3</td><td>0(0)</td><td>1(33)</td><td>0(0)</td><td>2(100)</td><td>2(17)</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class=""collapsible-figure-btn__wrapper collapsed""><button aria-controls=""table-498254-001"" aria-expanded=""false"" class=""btn collapsible-figure-btn btn--inverse""><i aria-hidden=""true"" class=""icon-arrow-down""></i><span class=""text-uppercase"">Expand Table</span></button></div></figure></div>

<b>Background:</b> Catequentinib Hydrochloride (AL3818, Anlotinib, Catequentinib) is a novel, orally administered, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor. There remains an unmet need for effective, well tolerated therapies for patients (pts) with advanced/ metastatic leiomyosarcoma (LMS). We performed a randomized, double blind trial of Catequentinib monotherapy versus placebo in advanced/metastatic LMS. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with a diagnosis of LMS requiring third or further line treatment were eligible. Catequentinib was administered in a 21-day cycle with 14 days on and 7 days off regimen. In this double blind phase 3 trial, patients were randomized 2:1 to Catequentinib or placebo, with the option of crossover to Catequentinib after confirmed Progression Disease (PD) on placebo. Progression-free survival (PFS) with Log Rank test was the primary endpoint and the trial was conducted at multiple sites in the US, UK and EU. <b>Results:</b> Total N = 111 patients were enrolled, and N = 110 were treated and evaluated, 74 randomized to Catequentinib (C), and 36 to placebo (P). In arms (C)/(P) median ages were 59.0/60.5 (range: 33-91) years respectively and 59/29 (79.7%/80.6%) were female. Median PFS by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) met the primary endpoint at 3.42 months (95% CI: 2.60, 6.83) for (C) and 1.41 months (95% CI: 1.35, 4.86) for (P) with a p-value of 0.0265 and a HR of 0.536 (95% CI: 0.307, 0.936). Median PFS for patients stratified at ≤ 3 prior lines was 4.86 months (95% CI: 2.04, 8.94) for (C) and 1.41 months (95% CI: 1.31, 4.86) for (P) with a p-value of 0.0046 and a HR of 0.386 (95% CI: 0.196, 0.760). The 6-month progression-free rate was 42.37% for (C) and 20.71% for (P). OS was 17.45 months (95% CI: 13.57, 19.32) for (C) and 16.33 months (95% CI: 11.27, NE) for crossover patients in the (P) arm. 30 (40.5%) of patients have experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events in the (C) arm compared to 3 (8.3%) of patients in the (P) arm. The most common TEAE for (C) vs (P) were diarrhea (50.0% vs 22.2%), stomatitis (31.1% vs 8.3%), fatigue (64.9% vs 41.7%), and hypertension (47.3% vs 19.4%). <b>Conclusions:</b> This phase 3 trial met the primary PFS endpoint and demonstrates superior PFS for Catequentinib vs placebo in metastatic/advanced LMS. This study confirms the acceptable benefit-risk profile of Catequentinib in LMS. Catequentinib is an effective and well tolerated treatment option for patients with LMS. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03016819"">NCT03016819</a>.",Sarcoma,NCT03016819

<b>Background:</b> Patients (pts) with HR NDMM have shown impaired survival outcomes even in the era of modern combination therapies. Establishing Isa-KRd in an intensified first-line regimen, the Phase II CONCEPT trial (NCT03104842) aimed at improving outcomes for HR NDMM pts for whom clinical trials had long been missing. <b>Methods:</b> The prospective, multicenter, academic Phase II CONCEPT trial has 2 parallel treatment arms according to transplant-eligibility. Adult NDMM pts with HR disease, defined as ≥1 HR cytogenetic aberration (CA) (del(17p), t(4;14), t(14;16), ≥3 copies 1q21) in combination with ISS stage II/III were included. All pts received Isa-KRd induction (6 cycles), intensification (HD-MEL+ASCT [TE pts; arm A] or 2 cycles Isa-KRd [non-TE pts; arm B]), 4 cycles Isa-KRd consolidation and 2 years Isa-KR maintenance. Primary endpoint is minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (NGF, 10<sup>-5</sup>) at the end of consolidation, tested against the null hypothesis MRD-neg rate ≤50% (TE pts); key secondary endpoints include survival times (PFS, OS). The trial recruited in 2 phases: 2017-2020 (TE+TNE; 1<sup>st</sup> cohort) and 2021-2022 (TE only; 2<sup>nd</sup> cohort), with a switch in carfilzomib application implemented in 2021 (1x weekly instead of 2x weekly). Interim results of the 1<sup>st</sup> cohort have been shown before. Here, we report for the first time the final analysis on the primary endpoint from the full cohort of TE pts. <b>Results:</b> 219 TE pts (and 26 TNE pts) were included and dosed. At data cut-off (9 Jan 2025), 66 pts were still on treatment. Median age of TE pts was 60 years (range, 31-73) with 119 and 100 showing ISS II and III. Del(17p) and gain1q were the most common HRCA (40.6% and 46.6%) and 35.6% had ≥2 HRCA. The trial met its primary endpoint with an MRD-neg rate after consolidation of 73.2% in the MRD-analysis population (153/209; 10 not assessable). Further analyses confirmed the benefit across different CA subgroups. Overall, 58.4% reached MRD-neg ≥CR, 86.8% reached MRD-neg at any time. 64.8% and 40.6% retained ≥1-year- and ≥2-year-sustained MRD-neg. With a median follow-up (mFU) of 42 mo (0-85.5 mo), mPFS for TE pts was 69.7 mo, while mOS has not been reached. For TNE pts (mFU 60 mo), mPFS and mOS have not been reached. Reaching and remaining in MRD-neg state led to a significant PFS benefit (<i>hr</i> 0.16 [0.08;0.32], time-dependent Cox regression). Carfilzomib 1x weekly resulted in fewer K discontinuations than 2x weekly dosing (0.6% and 4.8%, TE pts), with more dose reductions in the 1x weekly dosing (9.5% and 5.5%, TE pts). <b>Conclusions:</b> The full CONCEPT cohort represents the largest prospective trial cohort of purely HR NDMM pts reported so far. Isa-KRd resulted in unprecedented rates of MRD-neg., sustained MRD-neg. and survival supporting the use of Isa-KRd as a standard-of-care regime in this hard-to-treat population. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03104842"">NCT03104842</a>.",Hematologic Malignancies—Plasma Cell Dyscrasia,NCT03104842

<b>Background:</b> Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Up-regulated Factor (PAUF), a protein overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, contributes to metastasis and chemoresistance. PBP1510 is a first-in-class humanized anti-PAUF monoclonal antibody (mAb) with tumor-suppressing potential. PAUF-I (NCT05141149) is an ongoing, open-label, multi-national clinical study to evaluate PBP1510 in advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Safety results from the first two combination cohorts (PBP1510 and gemcitabine) are presented here. <b>Methods:</b> In Phase 1, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) are evaluated in a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design with 5 ascending doses (1, 3, 6, 10, and 15 mg/kg) of intravenous PBP1510 as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in 28-day cycles. The Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) observation period is 28 days. Tumor assessments are performed every 8 weeks from the first PBP1510 dose. Key eligibility criteria include locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, disease progression following at least 1 previous line of chemotherapy, at least 1 measurable lesion by RECIST v1.1, ECOG value of 0-1, life expectancy of ≥ 3 months, and adequate baseline organ functions. <b>Results:</b> Six patients [3M, 3F; age 65-77 (median: 73.5) years; 100% metastatic] exposed to 1-5 (median: 2.5) prior lines of systemic therapies were enrolled to receive PBP1510 at 1 mg/kg (N = 3), and 3 mg/kg (N = 3) in combination with gemcitabine. At data cut-off (6 Jan 2025), patients had received 1-6 treatment cycles (median: 2), and treatment for 3 patients in the 3 mg/kg cohort is ongoing. Overall, 73 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 5 patients (n = 73; N = 5). Most TEAEs were NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 (n = 38; N = 5) or Grade 2 (n = 26; N = 5). The most common Grade 1 and Grade 2 TEAEs were diarrhea (n = 4; N = 3) and hypokalemia (n = 3; N = 3), respectively. Of the Grade 3 TEAEs (n = 9; N = 4), the most reported were platelet count decreased (n = 3; N = 1). Of all TEAEs, 31 events were related to both PBP1510 and gemcitabine (n = 31; N = 4). The most reported TEAEs related to PBP1510 only and to gemcitabine only were diarrhea (n = 2; N = 1) and platelet count decreased (n = 8; N = 1), respectively. Most treatment-related TEAEs were Grade 1 (n = 14; N = 3) or Grade 2 (n = 13; N = 4). Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed for hematology (n = 7; N = 5; Grade 1-3) and blood chemistry (n = 4; N = 2; Grade 1-2). No DLTs and no serious TEAEs were reported. The evaluation of clinical activity and PK is ongoing. <b>Conclusions:</b> Interim safety data from the dose-escalation of PBP1510 demonstrate acceptable tolerability at up to 3 mg/kg in combination with gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients who had failed previous treatment(s). Clinical evaluation of PBP1510 in higher dose-level combination cohorts is ongoing. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05141149"">NCT05141149</a>.","Gastrointestinal Cancer—Gastroesophageal, Pancreatic, and Hepatobiliary",NCT05141149

<b>Background:</b> Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL). CCR8 is expressed in the skin resident memory T cells. ICP-B05 (CM369) is a humanized monoclonal antibody against CCR8 with potent ADCC activity. Here we report safety, efficacy and PK/PD findings for ICP-B05 during the dose-escalation stage of a Phase I study. <b>Methods:</b> Patients with R/R CTCL received ICP-B05 at 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg and 600 mg I.V. Q2W. Patients with R/R CTCL who failed at least 1 prior standard systemic regimen. Primary objectives included safety and tolerability of ICP-B05, MTD and RP2D. Secondary Objectives included the PK/PD and objective response per investigator. <b>Results:</b> By the cutoff date of 6<sup>th</sup> Jan, 2025, a total of 13 patients with R/R CTCL were treated, with 4 patients in 150 mg, and 3 patients each in 300 mg, 450 mg and 600mg, respectively. Eleven patients had a diagnosis of MF, one had SS and one had pcALCL. The median age was 46 years, and the median prior lines of therapy were 3 (2-6). There were 10/13 (76.9%) patients had lymph nodes involvement and 1/13 (7.7%) patient with SS had above 90% Sézary cells in peripheral blood at baseline. TEAEs occurred in 12 (92.3%) patients, and ≥Grade 3 TEAEs occurred in 6(46.2%) patients. The most common≥Grade 3 TEAEs is hematological AEs, including lymphopenia (8.3%), neutropenia (8.3%) and thrombocytopenia (8.3%). Two patients (16.7%) reported serious TEAEs, including edema and cardiac failure reported by the SS patient which was assessed as not related to ICP-B05, and thrombocytopenia and anemia reported by a MF patient. There was no fatal TEAE reported. There were 12 patients received at least one skin lesion assessment followed the mSWAT. 4/12 patients (33.3%) achieved PR, and 7patients (7/12, 58.3%) were assessed as SD with reduction (medium: - 27%) in skin lesion. The 6-month PFS rate was 82.5% (95% CI: 46.1%-95.3%). At baseline, CCR8+ in skin lesions (medium: 8.38%, range: 3.22–49.6%) was assessed in 11 out of 13 patients. Among the five patients with CCR8+ levels exceeding 10%, four (80%) achieved PR. PK analysis showed that serum exposure (C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0-14D</sub>) increased with dose escalation. PD analysis demontrated significant depletion of CCR8-expressing cells in CTCL skin lesions. Significant reduction of CCR8+ malignant T cells (-80%) and CCR8+ regulatory T cells (Treg, -68%) were observed at C3D1 compared with baseline in the skin lesion. Similar PD effects were observed in the peripheral blood as well with an average decrease of 91% in CCR8+ malignant T cells and 16% in Treg at C3D1 when compared with baseline. <b>Conclusions:</b> The current study is the first and only report on the preliminary efficacy data of anti-CCR8 targeted therapy for CTCL patients. The effectiveness of ICP-B05 was supported by the PD effects in both skin lesions and peripheral blood in the depletion of CCR8+ cells. ICP-B05 is safe and well tolerated and its safety profile made it a good candidate for combo therapies for CTCL patients with lymph node and other organ involvement. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05690581"">NCT05690581</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05690581

<b>Background:</b> Adrixetinib (Q702) is an orally administrated novel Axl/Mer/CSF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which the primary mechanism of action of tumor regression is through immune-stimulating effects. The safety profile, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy data for Q702 in combination with pembrolizumab are presented. <b>Methods:</b> QRNT-008 (NCT05438420) is an ongoing Phase 1b/2 multicenter, open-label, dose escalation and expansion study in patients with advanced esophageal, gastric/GEJ, hepatocellular, and cervical cancers who have progressed on prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. The Part 1 dose escalation was guided by a mTPI design to determine the Part 2 dose of Q702 in combination with pembrolizumab. Patients received Q702 (week on/off dosing regimen) orally at 100 mg or 120 mg doses in combination with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W) intravenously in 42-day cycles. <b>Results:</b> As of the data cutoff (December 19th, 2024), 29 patients received Q702 plus pembrolizumab across 2 dose levels: 7 patients at 100 mg and 22 patients at 120 mg. The median number of prior lines of systemic therapy was 4 (range 1-7). Of the 29 patients (3 esophageal; 11 gastric; 2 GEJ; 9 hepatocellular; 4 cervical) who received Q702 across all doses, there were no treatment discontinuations due to the treatment-related AEs (TRAEs). Most common TRAEs ≥10% were AST increase (51.7%), ALT increase (41.3%), CPK increase (37.8%) and LDH increase (34.5%). One patient dosed at 120 mg experienced 1 DLT (G3 skin rash and G3 diarrhea). Adrixetinib PK analyses showed dose dependent increase of AUC<sub>0-last </sub>and C<sub>max</sub>. Overall response assessment (RECIST 1.1) included 1 confirmed complete response (CR) in a patient with metastatic gastric cancer (GC) and 6 patients with stable disease (SD) across multiple tumor types. Among 6 SD patients, 1 GC and 1 hepatocellular cancer (HCC) patient continued treatment for ≥24 weeks. <b>Conclusions:</b> Preliminary data from QRNT-008 study showed that selective Axl/Mer/CSF1R inhibitor Q702 plus pembrolizumab has a manageable safety profile. The Part 2 dose of Adrixetinib is confirmed at 120 mg. Preliminary anti-tumor activity in patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 supports further development of the combination. <a>Clinical trial information: </a><a href=""http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05438420"">NCT05438420</a>.",Developmental Therapeutics—Immunotherapy,NCT05438420
