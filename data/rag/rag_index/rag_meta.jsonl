It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This guidance provides recommendations to applicants on endpoints for cancer clinical trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support effectiveness claims in new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), or supplemental applications.2 It also provides background information and discusses general regulatory principles. The endpoints discussed in this guidance are for drugs to treat patients with an existing cancer.3 This guidance does not address endpoints for drugs to prevent or decrease the incidence of cancer. This guidance is a revision of the final guidance of the same title that published in May 2007. This guidance replaces the May 2007 guidance of the same title. In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs include both human drugs and biological products unless otherwise specified. 3 See the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics for recommendations specific to non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. See the guidance for industry Pathological Complete Response in Neoadjuvant Treatment of High-Risk Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Use as an Endpoint to Support Accelerated Approval for recommendations specific to high-risk early-stage breast cancer. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA web page.

In conventional oncology drug development, early phase clinical trials evaluate safety and identify evidence of biological drug activity, such as tumor shrinkage. Endpoints for later phase efficacy studies commonly evaluate whether a drug provides a clinical benefit such as prolongation of survival or an improvement in symptoms. The following sections discuss the general regulatory requirements for efficacy and how they have influenced endpoint selection for the approval of cancer drugs.

In conventional oncology drug development, early phase clinical trials evaluate safety and identify evidence of biological drug activity, such as tumor shrinkage. Endpoints for later phase efficacy studies commonly evaluate whether a drug provides a clinical benefit such as prolongation of survival or an improvement in symptoms. The following sections discuss the general regulatory requirements for efficacy and how they have influenced endpoint selection for the approval of cancer drugs. Later sections describe these endpoints in more detail and discuss whether they might serve as measures of disease activity or clinical benefit in various clinical settings. A. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements for Effectiveness The requirement that new drugs show effectiveness is based on a 1962 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This law requires substantial evidence of effectiveness and specifies that this evidence must be derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations. Similarly, the Public Health Service Act requires biological products to be safe, pure, and potent.4 Clinical benefits that have supported drug approval have included important clinical outcomes (e.g., increased survival, symptomatic improvement) but have also included effects on surrogate endpoints known to predict clinical benefit (e.g., blood pressure). The accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR part 314, subpart H and 21 CFR part 601, subpart E), promulgated in 1992, allow use of additional endpoints for approval of drugs or biological products that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and that generally demonstrate an improvement over available therapy or provide therapy where none exists. In this setting, the FDA may grant approval based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.5 Such surrogate endpoints are less well- established than those surrogate endpoints for traditional approvals, such as blood pressure for cardiovascular disease. FDA may also grant accelerated approval based on an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint).6 A drug is approved under the accelerated approval regulations on condition that the manufacturer conducts clinical studies to verify and describe the actual clinical benefit.7 If the postmarketing studies fail to demonstrate clinical benefit or if the applicant does not demonstrate due diligence in conducting the required studies, among other reasons, FDA may withdraw approval of the drug or indication.8 In the following discussion, the term traditional approval denotes the longstanding route of drug approval based on the demonstration of clinical benefit or an effect on a surrogate endpoint 4 Potency has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (21 CFR 600.3(s)). 5 Section 506(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act. 21 CFR 314.510 and 601.41 provide that the Agency may consider “. . . epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence . . .” in determining whether an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 provides that FDA may consider “. . . epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools.” See guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 6 See guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 7 For a more comprehensive discussion of this condition of accelerated approval and a discussion of other conditions of approval, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 8 See section 506(c)(3) of the FD&C Act and §§ 314.530(a) and 601.43(a). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 3 known to predict clinical benefit. That term is distinguished from accelerated approval, which is associated with use of a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to support drug approval. The evidence needed to establish effectiveness is discussed in the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products and the guidance for industry FDA Approval of New Cancer Treatment Uses for Marketed Drug and Biological Products. In many cases, at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations are needed. In certain cases, evidence from a single adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation, with confirmatory evidence, can be sufficient (e.g., in cases in which a single multicenter study provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit). FDA may consider data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence as substantial evidence, if FDA determines that such data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness.9 For example, for drugs approved for treatment of patients with a specific stage of a particular malignancy, evidence from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence may be sufficient to support an efficacy supplement for treatment of a different stage of the same cancer. B. Endpoints Supporting Past Approvals in Oncology For traditional approval, applicants show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in a surrogate endpoint known to predict clinical benefit. In oncology, survival improvement is considered an appropriate measure of clinical benefit. In addition, sponsors have used other endpoints for cancer drug approval.

B. Endpoints Supporting Past Approvals in Oncology For traditional approval, applicants show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in a surrogate endpoint known to predict clinical benefit. In oncology, survival improvement is considered an appropriate measure of clinical benefit. In addition, sponsors have used other endpoints for cancer drug approval. In the 1970s, the FDA usually approved cancer drugs based on objective response rate (ORR), determined by tumor assessments from radiological tests or physical examinations. In the early 1980s, after discussion with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), the FDA determined that cancer drug approval should be based on more direct evidence of clinical benefit, such as improvement in survival, improvement in a patient’s quality of life, improved physical functioning, or improved tumor-related symptoms. These benefits may not always be predicted by, or correlate with, ORR. Over time, larger improvements in tumor reduction and delay in tumor growth have been seen, and tumor measurement endpoints have been used to support both traditional and accelerated approval. Improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) has supported drug approval in selected adjuvant settings, in which a large proportion of patients were expected to have cancer symptoms at the time of recurrence. Durable complete response has supported traditional approval in leukemia, where complete response (CR) is associated with less infection, bleeding, and blood product support. A large improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) or high, substantiated durable ORR has been used to support traditional approval in select malignancies, but magnitude of effect, relief of tumor-related symptoms, and drug toxicity should also be considered when making the approval decision.10,11,12 For example, randomized trials for 9 See section 505(d) as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. 10 Blumenthal GM, PG Kluetz, J Schneider, KB Goldberg, AE McKee, R Pazdur, 2017, Oncology Drug Approvals: Evaluating Endpoints and Evidence in an Era of Breakthrough Therapies, The Oncologist, 22(7): 762-767. 11 Blumenthal GM and R Pazdur, 2016, Response Rate as an Approval Endpoint in Oncology: Back to the Future, JAMA Oncol, 2(6): 720-721. 12 O’Shaughnessy and Wittes et al.,1991, Commentary Concerning Demonstration of Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Anticancer Agents in Clinical Trials, J Clin Oncol, 9:2225-2232. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 4 hormonal drugs for breast cancer and a single arm trial of a drug for ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have used ORR as an endpoint supporting traditional approval. Improvement in tumor-related symptoms in conjunction with an improved ORR and adequate response duration has supported traditional approval in several clinical settings. Surrogate endpoints for accelerated approval must be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (FD&C Act § 506(c)(1)(A); 21 CFR part 314, subpart H; and 21 CFR part 601, subpart E). While durable ORR has been used as a traditional approval endpoint in some circumstances, ORR has also been the most commonly used surrogate endpoint in support of accelerated approval. Tumor response is widely accepted by oncologists in guiding cancer treatments. Because ORR is directly attributable to drug effect, single-arm trials conducted in patients with refractory tumors where no available therapy exists provide an accurate assessment of ORR. Whether tumor measures such as ORR or PFS are used as an accelerated approval or traditional approval endpoint will depend on the disease context and the magnitude of the effect, among other factors (see sections III.B.2 and 4). III. GENERAL ENDPOINT CONSIDERATIONS This section provides an overview of general issues in cancer drug development. A discussion of commonly used cancer endpoints is followed by a discussion of pertinent issues in cancer clinical trial design using these endpoints (see the guidances referenced in footnote 3 regarding non-small cell lung cancer and high-risk early-stage breast cancer for more detailed discussion for these diseases). The endpoints that are discussed in this section include overall survival, endpoints based on tumor assessments (e.g., DFS, event-free survival (EFS), ORR, CR, time to progression (TTP), and PFS), endpoints involving symptom assessment, blood or body fluid- based biomarkers, and emerging endpoints. Tables 1 and 2 provide a comparison of endpoints in cancer drug approval.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 5 Table 1. A Comparison of Important Cancer Approval Endpoints As noted in the table, several oncology endpoints can serve different purposes (i.e., clinical endpoint that represents clinical benefit for traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval) based on the specific context of use. The determination is based on the specific diseases and is highly dependent upon factors such as effect size, effect duration, depth of response (e.g., number of CRs), available therapy, disease setting, location of disease, the clinical consequences of delaying or preventing disease progression or delaying administration of more toxic therapies, and the risk-benefit relationship. See text for details. See section V regarding recommendations for obtaining FDA feedback on endpoints and protocol design.

Overall Survival Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and is measured in the intent-to-treat population. Survival is considered the most reliable cancer endpoint, and when studies can be conducted to adequately assess survival, it is usually the preferred endpoint. This endpoint is precise and easy to measure, documented by the date of death. Bias is not a factor in endpoint measurement. Survival improvement should be analyzed as a risk-benefit analysis to assess clinical benefit. Overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies. Data derived from externally controlled trials are seldom reliable for time-to-event endpoints, including overall survival. Apparent differences in outcome between external controls and current treatment groups can arise from differences other than drug treatment, including patient selection, improved imaging techniques, or improved supportive care.

Demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is acceptable and has often supported new drug approval. Difficulties in performing and analyzing survival studies include long follow-up periods in large trials and subsequent cancer therapy potentially confounding survival analysis. B. Endpoints Based on Tumor Assessments This section discusses several endpoints that are based on tumor assessments. In many cancer types, radiographic tumor assessments directly measure components of the disease, and tumor measures commonly trigger treatment decisions in clinical practice. Therefore, tumor measure- based endpoints are considered more clinically relevant than other biomarkers. Tumor measure- based endpoints may support either traditional (as a clinical endpoint that represents clinical benefit or a surrogate endpoint for traditional approval) or accelerated approval and include DFS (and EFS), ORR, CR, TTP, and PFS. Tumor assessment endpoint selection should include two judgments. First, a determination of whether the endpoint may support either accelerated approval or traditional approval should be ascertained. Second, the endpoint should be evaluated for the potential of bias or uncertainty. Drug applications using studies that rely on tumor assessment endpoints as sole evidence of efficacy may need confirmatory evidence from a second trial. Accuracy in measuring tumors can differ among tumor settings. Tumor measurements used in ORR determinations can be imprecise in locations where there is a lack of demarcated margins (e.g., pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors). When the primary study endpoint is based on tumor measurements (e.g., PFS or ORR), tumor assessments generally should be verified by central reviewers blinded to study treatments (see Appendix) to ascertain lack of assessment bias. Additional details regarding data collection are listed in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, Appendix A.16 Alternatively, a random sample-based blinded central review auditing approach could be used with a detailed auditing plan prespecified including a strategy to detect potential assessment bias. If bias cannot be excluded based upon the audit, a blinded central review of all radiographic images will be necessary. 17 Sponsors should seek FDA input prior to conducting an audit based central review. Centralized independent verification of tumor assessment endpoints (especially for PFS or DFS) may not be necessary when randomized trials are blinded (unless the adverse event profile would substantially unblind the trial in practice) or effect sizes are robust in large randomized trials where sensitivity analysis supports lack of investigator bias. 1. Disease-Free Survival (and Event-Free Survival) Generally, DFS is defined as the time from randomization until disease recurrence or death from any cause. The most frequent use of this endpoint is in the adjuvant setting after definitive surgery or radiotherapy. DFS also can be an important endpoint when a large percentage of patients achieve CRs with chemotherapy. Although overall survival is a conventional endpoint for most adjuvant settings, DFS can be an important endpoint in situations where survival may be prolonged, making an overall survival endpoint impractical. An endpoint that is similar to DFS but is differentiated from it in that randomization takes place before definitive surgery or radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting is EFS. For the purpose of this guidance, EFS is defined as time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause. DFS has been the primary basis of approval for adjuvant breast cancer hormonal therapy, adjuvant colon cancer, and adjuvant cytotoxic breast cancer therapy, whereas EFS is an appropriate endpoint for the evaluation of neoadjuvant breast cancer therapy given prior to definitive surgery. Compared with standard cytotoxic therapies, hormonal therapies carry minimal side effects and thus a favorable risk- benefit relationship. Treatment effect measured by DFS or EFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, available therapy, and the risk-benefit relationship. In December 2003, the ODAC consensus was DFS prolongation represented clinical benefit if the magnitude of this benefit outweighed the toxicity of the adjuvant treatment. In May 2004, the ODAC recommended that DFS be considered a clinical endpoint for colon cancer drugs in the surgical adjuvant setting. 18 DFS has been used for traditional approval for diseases such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

Important considerations in evaluating DFS or EFS as a potential endpoint include the estimated size of the treatment effect and proven benefits of standard therapies. The protocol should 16 Appendices A-D in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, regarding tumor measurement data collection and PFS analysis also apply more broadly to oncology endpoints and should be used in conjunction with this guidance, as needed. 17 Discussed during July 24, 2012 ODAC meeting.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 9 carefully delineate both the definition of DFS or EFS and the schedule for follow-up assessments and visits. Unscheduled assessments can occur for many reasons and differences between study arms in the frequency, timing, or reason for unscheduled assessments can introduce bias. Bias can be minimized by blinding patients and investigators to the treatment assignments, as appropriate. Application of the definition of DFS or EFS in a study can be complicated, particularly when deaths are noted without prior tumor progression documentation. These events can be scored either as disease recurrences or as censored events. Although all methods for statistical analysis of deaths have some limitations, considering deaths from all causes as recurrences can minimize bias. DFS or EFS can be overestimated using this definition, especially in patients who die after a long period without observation. Bias can be introduced if the frequency of long-term follow-up visits is dissimilar between the study arms or if dropouts are not random because of toxicity. Some analyses count cancer-related deaths as DFS or EFS events and censor noncancer deaths. This method can introduce bias in the attribution of the cause of death. Furthermore, any method that censors observations on patients, whether at death or at the last visit, assumes that the patients with censored observations have the same risk of recurrence as patients with noncensored observations who have not yet experienced the event. 2. Objective Response Rate ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. Generally, the FDA has defined ORR as the sum of partial responses plus CRs. When defined in this manner, ORR is a direct measure of a drug antitumor activity, which can be evaluated in a single-arm study. Stable disease should not be a component of ORR. Stable disease can reflect the natural history of disease, whereas tumor reduction is a direct therapeutic effect. Also, stable disease can be more accurately assessed by TTP or PFS analysis (see section III.B.4). If available, standardized criteria should be used to ascertain response. A variety of response criteria have been considered appropriate (e.g., revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1)) 19 The response criteria should be predefined in the protocol before the start of the study. The significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration, and the percentage of CRs. Treatment effect measured by ORR can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the number of CRs, the durability of response, the disease setting, the location of the tumors, available therapy, and the risk-benefit relationship. 3. Complete Response CR is defined as no detectable evidence of tumor. CR is generally measured through imaging studies (e.g., CT scans) or through histopathologic assessment (e.g., bone marrow biopsy or breast cancer resection specimens). Treatment effect measured by CR can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the 19 Eisenhauer EA, P Therasse, J Bogaerts, LH Schwartz, D Sargent, R Ford, et al., 2009, New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1), Eur J Cancer, 45(2):228-247.

For early high-risk breast cancer, pathologic CR (pCR) has been used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval. 4. Time to Progression and Progression- Free Survival TTP and PFS have served as primary endpoints for drug approval. TTP is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first. The precise definition of tumor progression is important and should be carefully detailed in the protocol. Compared with TTP, PFS is the preferred regulatory endpoint. PFS includes deaths and thus can be a better correlate to overall survival. In TTP analysis, death events are censored, either at the time of death or at an earlier visit representing informative censoring (nonrandom pattern of loss from the study). PFS assumes that death events are randomly related to tumor progression. PFS can reflect tumor growth and be assessed before the determination of a survival benefit. Its determination is not confounded by subsequent therapy. For a given sample size, the magnitude of effect on PFS can be larger than the effect on overall survival. Data are usually insufficient to allow a robust evaluation of the correlation between effects on overall survival and PFS. Cancer trials are often small, and proven survival benefits of existing drugs are generally modest. Treatment effect measured by PFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, location of metastatic sites, available therapy, the risk-benefit relationship, and the clinical consequences of delaying or preventing progression in key disease sites (e.g., delay of new lesions in the brain or spine) or delaying administration of more toxic therapies. It is important to carefully define tumor progression criteria in the protocol. There are no standard regulatory criteria for defining progression. Applicants have used a variety of different criteria, including the RECIST criteria. The broad outline presented in most published PFS criteria should be supplemented with additional details in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP). Because progression data can be collected from multiple sources (including physical exams at unscheduled visits and radiological scans of various types) and at different times, data collection for each assessment visit should be limited to a specified short time interval around the scheduled visit. Difficulties can arise in determining the event date and censoring date when data are collected over a prolonged time period. We recommend assigning the progression date to the earliest time when any progression is observed without prior missing assessments and censoring at the date when the last radiological assessment determined a lack of progression. The guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, Appendices C and D provides a set of tables for potential analyses of PFS that can be used for primary or sensitivity analyses. Plans for PFS data collection and analysis should be discussed with FDA at end-of-phase 2 meetings. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 11 5. Time to Treatment Failure Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death. TTF is generally not recommended as a regulatory endpoint for new molecular entity drug approval. C. Endpoints Involving Symptom Assessment Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit. FDA drug approvals have used patient symptom assessments and/or physical signs representing symptomatic improvement (e.g., weight gain, decreased effusion) as an important efficacy endpoint. For the improvement of signs and symptoms or other clinical outcome assessments (COA) to be used as efficacy endpoints to support cancer drug approval, symptoms should be assessed that are due to cancer rather than drug toxicity to the extent possible. 1. Specific Symptom Endpoints Symptom improvement/palliation is a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a surrogate endpoint. A decrease in the severity of cancer symptoms has been used to support traditional approval of anti-cancer agents where anti-tumor activity has also been demonstrated. The use of a symptom palliation endpoint requires that the population be symptomatic at baseline, which can be problematic in many cancer trials where patients can often be asymptomatic at baseline. This endpoint can also be subject to open label response bias, the magnitude of which is not well described. Time to progression of cancer symptoms, an endpoint similar to TTP, is also a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a potential surrogate endpoint. As discussed earlier, problems in measuring progression (e.g., missing assessments) also exist in evaluating time to symptomatic progression. Because few cancer"}

Time to progression of cancer symptoms, an endpoint similar to TTP, is also a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a potential surrogate endpoint. As discussed earlier, problems in measuring progression (e.g., missing assessments) also exist in evaluating time to symptomatic progression. Because few cancer trials are blinded, symptom assessments can also be subject to response bias. A delay between tumor progression and the onset of cancer symptoms can occur. Often alternative treatments are initiated before achieving the symptom endpoint, confounding this analysis. In addition, tumor symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from drug toxicity. A composite symptom endpoint or symptom scale should have components of similar clinical importance and an analysis of the contribution of the components should be submitted with the primary analysis of the overall composite endpoint. An example is the composite symptom scale that includes several important symptoms of myelofibrosis, the myelofibrosis symptom assessment form. 20 An example of a composite endpoint for clinical events exists for patients with cancer metastases to the skeleton. Drugs have been approved based on delaying the time to skeletal-related events defined as pathological fractures, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression. 20 Deisseroth A, E Kamiskas, J Grillo, W Chen, H Saber, HL Lu, et. al., 2012, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval: Ruxolitinib for the Treatment of Patients with Intermediate and High -Risk Myelofibrosis, Clin Cancer Res, 18(12): 3212-7. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 12 Selection of the appropriate population can be critical for documenting symptom benefit. Patients symptomatic at study baseline can be evaluated with a categorical symptom response analysis. In asymptomatic patients at baseline, a time-to-first-symptom analysis can be used, although this approach can be limited by intermittent missing data and discontinuation of the study drug prior to symptomatic progression. 2. Problems Encountered with Symptom Data Missing data and infrequent assessments can complicate the evaluation of symptom data particularly for time to deterioration analyses. Procedures should be put in place to maximize completion rate during trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan should outline how missing data will be handled. Data collection to support multiple symptom endpoints should be addressed prospectively regarding multiple hypotheses testing and the necessary statistical adjustments should be specified in the SAP. Additional information on the use of patient- reported outcomes can be found in the guidance for industry Patient Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims. D. Blood or Body Fluid- Based Biomarkers Generally, biomarkers assayed from blood or body fluids have not served as primary endpoints for cancer drug approval, although paraprotein levels measured in blood and urine have been used as part of myeloma response criteria, and durable major molecular response is a surrogate endpoint used for traditional approval for therapies in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The FDA has accepted blood-based markers as elements of a composite endpoint. The occurrence of certain clinical events (a significant decrease in performance status, or bowel obstruction) in conjunction with marked increases in CA-125 was considered progression in ovarian cancer patients. In addition, blood-based biomarkers can be useful in identifying prognostic factors and in selection of patients and stratification factors to be considered in study designs. E. Emerging Endpoints In addition to the endpoints discussed in this section, FDA recognizes that advances in science are facilitating development of oncology products, which may also result in the identification of additional endpoints that may be used to support approval of oncology products. As examples, minimal residual disease 21 has been used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval for a therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and metastasis-free survival has been used as a clinical endpoint for traditional approval for a therapy in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. If a sponsor is planning to use an emerging endpoint in its clinical development program, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V). 21 See draft guidance for industry Hematologic Malignancies: Regulatory Considerations for Use in Minimal Residual Disease in Development of Drug and Biological Products for Treatment for information to assist sponsors planning to use minimal residual disease to support marketing approval of drugs and biological products for the treatment of specific hematologic malignancies. When finalized this guidance will represent FDA current thinking on the topics it addresses. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 13 IV. CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS Per 21 CFR 314.126, the FDA approves drugs based on substantial evidence of efficacy from “adequate and well-controlled investigations,” as described in the regulations. Studies must allow a valid comparison to a control and must provide a quantitative assessment of the drug’s effect. 22 The most reliable method for demonstrating efficacy is to show a statistically significant improvement in a clinically meaningful endpoint in randomized controlled trials"}

When finalized this guidance will represent FDA current thinking on the topics it addresses. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 13 IV. CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS Per 21 CFR 314.126, the FDA approves drugs based on substantial evidence of efficacy from “adequate and well-controlled investigations,” as described in the regulations. Studies must allow a valid comparison to a control and must provide a quantitative assessment of the drug’s effect. 22 The most reliable method for demonstrating efficacy is to show a statistically significant improvement in a clinically meaningful endpoint in randomized controlled trials (i.e., superiority). The following sections discuss other approaches that may be indicated when a randomized controlled trial demonstrating superiority is not feasible or ethical. If a sponsor is planning to use one of these approaches, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V). A. S ingle-Arm Studies In settings where there is no available therapy and where major tumor regressions can be presumed to be attributed to the tested drug, the FDA has sometimes accepted ORR and response duration observed in single-arm studies as substantial evidence supporting accelerated approval. Response rates have been used in settings such as acute leukemia for traditional approval where CRs have been associated with decreased transfusion requirements, decrease in infections, and increased survival. Single-arm trials do not adequately characterize time-to- event endpoints such as overall survival, DFS (and EFS), TTP, or PFS. Because of variability in the natural history of many forms of cancer, a randomized study is necessary to evaluate time-to-event endpoints. B. Randomized Studies Designed to Demonstrate Noninferiority A noninferiority (NI) trial should demonstrate the new drug’s effectiveness by showing that the new drug is not less effective than a standard regimen (the active control) by a prespecified amount (noninferiority margin). 23 This noninferiority margin should be a clinically acceptable loss that is not larger than the effect of the active control drug. The standard regimen should have a well-characterized clinical benefit (survival benefit). If the new drug is inferior to the active control by more than the noninferiority margin, it will be presumed to be ineffective. NI trials rely on externally controlled (historical) data to establish the active control’s treatment effect size. In cancer trials, this effect frequently has not been adequately characterized. NI trials also rely on constancy assumption. This assumption includes that the active-control effect has remained constant between the externally controlled study and the current study. This assumes constancy of patient population characteristics, supportive care measures, and evaluation techniques between the current trial and the externally controlled data from which the active-control effect was derived. The estimated size of the active-control’s treatment effect should be based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of externally controlled studies. These studies should reliably reproduce the active-control effect compared with placebo arm. 22 See 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2) and (7). 23 See guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness. See also the ICH guidance for industry E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 14 Difficulties in conducting NI trials include the estimation of active-control effect and the determination of amount of effect (NI margin) to be retained. NI trials usually involve large sample sizes compared with superiority trials and involve replication of clinical trial results. Furthermore, subsequent therapies and crossover to the active-control arm can confound any NI analysis. NI trials with endpoints other than overall survival and ORR are problematic. C. Trial Designs for Radiotherapy Protectants and Chemotherapy Protectants Radiotherapy protectants and chemotherapy protectants are drugs designed to ameliorate the toxicities of therapies. These trials usually have two objectives. The first is to assess the amelioration of cancer treatment toxicity. The second objective is to determine whether anticancer activity is compromised by the protectant. The second objective usually examines earlier endpoints; for example, ORR or PFS, rather than overall survival. D. Clinical Trial Design Considerations The methodology for assessing, measuring, and analyzing the endpoint(s) should be detailed in the protocol and SAP. Visits and radiological assessments, when applicable, should be symmetric between the two study arms to prevent systematic bias. The FDA and the applicant should agree prospectively on the following items and the applicant should finalize the items before the initiation of the study, to the extent possible: • The study design • The definition of progression • The SAP • The methodology for handling missing data and censoring methods • The data to be recorded on the case report form (CRF) • The operating procedures of an independent endpoint review committee (IRC), if applicable (see Appendix) E. C linical Trial Analysis Issues Missing data can complicate endpoint analysis. For endpoints based on tumor assessments, the protocol should define an adequate assessment visit for each patient (i.e., a visit when all scheduled tumor assessments have been done). The analysis plan should outline a comparison of the adequacy of follow-up in each treatment arm. Methodology for analyzing incomplete and/or missing follow-up visits and censoring methods should be specified in the protocol. The analysis plan should specify the"}

The analysis plan should specify the primary analysis and one or more sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. Although any analyses with missing data can be problematic, the results can be strengthened by similar results in both the primary and the sensitivity analyses. When applicable, the evaluation should include the number of deaths in patients who have been lost to follow-up for a prolonged time period. For example, an imbalance in such deaths could bias a PFS measurement by overestimating PFS in the treatment arm with less follow-up. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 15 V. CONCLUSION Although the general principles outlined in this guidance should help applicants select endpoints for marketing applications, we recommend that applicants meet with the FDA before submitting protocols intended to support NDA or BLA marketing applications. The FDA will ensure that these meetings include a multidisciplinary FDA team of oncologists, statisticians, clinical pharmacologists, and external expert consultants as needed. Applicants can submit protocols after these meetings and request a special protocol assessment that provides confirmation of the acceptability of endpoints and protocol design to support drug marketing applications. 24 Ultimately, of course, marketing approval depends not only on the design of clinical trials, but on FDA review of the results and data from all studies in the drug marketing application. 24 See the guidance for industry Special Protocol Assessment. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 16 APPENDIX: INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF TUMOR ENDPOINTS Clinical trial results that support drug approval should be verifiable by applicants and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Objective response rate (ORR) determined in single-arm studies can be evaluated by reviewing a limited number of images. When drug approval is based on measurement of progression-free survival (PFS), careful planning can minimize bias and enable the applicant and the FDA to verify results. An independent endpoint review committee (IRC) can minimize bias in radiographic interpretation of the radiological findings and independent adjudication of assessments. A clearly written plan of the charter outlining the IRC function and process (independent review charter) should be in place before initiation of the study. The plan should describe the assurance of the committee’s independence and procedure for collection, storage, and transportation of the results. The charter also should include the resolution of differences in interpretation and incorporation of clinical data in the final interpretation of data and audit procedures. The use of an IRC is discussed further in the guidance for industry Developing Medical Imaging Drug and Biological Products, Part 3: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Clinical Studies."}

Executive Summary This is both an updated study of clinical drug development success rates from our 2016 report, and an expansion into the drivers of success with the addition of machine learning modeling to analyze the predictive factors contributing to drug development. A total of 12,728 clinical and regulatory phase transitions were recorded and analyzed from 9,704 development programs over the last decade (2011–2020), across 1,779 companies in the Biomedtracker database. Phase transitions occur when a drug candidate advances into the next phase of development or is suspended by the sponsor. By calculating the number of programs progressing to the next phase vs the total number progressing and suspended, we assessed the success rate at each of the four phases of development: Phase I, II, III, and regulatory filing. Having phase-by-phase data in hand, we then compared groups of diseases, drug modalities, and other attributes to generate the most comprehensive analysis yet of biopharmaceutical R&D success. This work was made possible due to the years of clinical program monitoring and data entry by Informa Pharma Intelligence’s Biomedtracker, which subsequently populates the purpose-built Probability of Technical Success (PTS) tool, Pharmapremia. BIO has long worked with Biomedtracker to calculate success rates based on this data. More recently, BIO and Biomedtracker teamed up with QLS Advisors, a team of expert data scientists who apply machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to clinical trials data and drug properties to assess the features that contribute the most amount, positively or negatively, to the probability of approval. The computational analyses of over 200 different drug, trial, indication, and sponsor metrics that influence clinical success rates were applied in a predictive capacity to produce risk assessments and evaluations of R&D assets with increased accuracy. Key Takeaways • The overall likelihood of approval (LOA) from Phase I for all developmental candidates over 2011–2020 was 7.9%. • Phase II development remains the largest hurdle in drug development, with just 28.9% of candidates achieving this critical phase transition. • Of the 14 major disease areas, Hematology therapies had the highest LOA from Phase I (23.9%), representing a seven-fold increase over the least successful group, Urology (3.6%). • Immuno-oncology therapies provide a rare pocket of success in oncology R&D with an overall LOA of 12.4% vs 5.3% for all oncology approaches. • Rare disease therapies were notably successful with an overall LOA of 17.0%. • Chronic, high prevalence disease therapies were less successful with an overall LOA of 5.9%. • Biological complexity in drug modalities generally leads to higher LOA, with CAR-T and RNA interference achieving the highest LOAs of 17.3% and 13.5%, respectively. • Development programs with trials employing patient preselection biomarkers have two-fold higher LOAs (15.9%), driven by a Phase II success rate of nearly one-in-two. • The top contributing factors toward phase success are disease indication, target, modality, and drug novelty. • On average, it takes 10.5 years for a Phase I asset to progress to regulatory approval. Disease areas with above-average LOAs tend to have the shortest development timelines.

Introduction This study aimed to measure clinical development success rates, contributing factors to those outcomes, and timelines of clinical trials. With the goal of providing current benchmarking metrics for drug development, this study covers the most recent decade of individual drug program phase transitions from January 1, 2011, to November 30, 2020. A phase transition is defined as the movement out of a clinical phase – for example, advancing from Phase I to Phase II development, or being suspended after completion of Phase I development. Three separate analyses were conducted. Part 1 of this report includes clinical development success rates based on 12,728 transitions in the Biomedtracker database. These transitions occurred in 9,704 clinical drug development programs over the last decade. Within this broad set of data, we segmented and analyzed success in drug development across levels of novelty, molecular modalities, and disease indications. As this study cuts across 1,779 companies, roughly the entire spectrum of biopharma companies was included. This is illustrated with 15 companies each contributing more than 100 transitions, while 748 smaller biotechs contributed just one transition each. Only company-sponsored, FDA registration-enabling development programs were included in this analysis. Investigator-sponsored studies and combinations with other investigational drugs were excluded. A more detailed description of the data collection, composition, and analysis methodologies is provided in the “Methods” section. The second analysis applies big data analytics to uncover the underlying drivers of drug development success. Despite the successful application of machine learning techniques to libraries of billions of chemical and biological compounds in order to identify potential drug candidates, most drug developers and financial analysts still rely on historical observation to derive estimates of the clinical trial success rate when analyzing pipelines of investigational drugs. QLS Advisors, a technology and advisory company dedicated to fostering innovation in the life sciences, applies machine-learning techniques to predict the outcomes of randomized clinical trials. In Part 2 of this report, QLS Advisors explores how investors in the biopharma industry can use machine learning to characterize the probability of success for regulatory approval of a novel therapy. An analysis of clinical timelines is included in Part 3. Here we measure the time it takes for drug development programs at each clinical phase to transition upon success to the next phase. 6/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Part 1. Phase Transition Success and Likelihood of Approvals Success rates for individual phases of the drug development process were determined by dividing the number that successfully advanced to the next phase by the total number advanced and suspended. This “advanced and suspended” number is often referred to as “n” in this report and should be taken into account when drawing conclusions from the success rate results. Consistent with previous studies of drug development phase transition success rates, we found Phase II success rates to be far lower than any other phase. 1,2 Phase I and III rates were substantially higher than Phase II, with Phase I slightly lower than Phase III. The highest success rate of the four development phases was the New Drug Application (NDA)/ Biologic License Application (BLA) filing phase (Figure 1). The Phase I transition success rate was 52.0% (n=4,414). As this phase is typically conducted for safety testing and is not dependent on efficacy for candidates to advance, it is common for this phase to have a higher success rate among the clinical phases across most categories analyzed in this report. However, Phase I success rates also may benefit from delayed reporting or omission bias, as some larger companies may not deem failed Phase I programs as material and thereby not report them in the public domain. The Phase II transition success rate (28.9%, n=4,933) was substantially lower than Phase I, and the lowest of the four phases studied.

However, Phase I success rates also may benefit from delayed reporting or omission bias, as some larger companies may not deem failed Phase I programs as material and thereby not report them in the public domain. The Phase II transition success rate (28.9%, n=4,933) was substantially lower than Phase I, and the lowest of the four phases studied. As this is generally the first stage where proof-of-concept is deliberately tested in human subjects, Phase II consistently has the lowest success rate of all phases. This is also the point in development where industry must decide whether to pursue large, expensive Phase III studies, or to terminate development – this may be done for multiple reasons, including commercial viability. The second- highest phase transition success rate was found in Phase III (57.8%, n=1,928). This is significant as most company-sponsored Phase III trials are the longest and most expensive trials to conduct. The probability of FDA approval after submitting an NDA or BLA, taking into account re-submissions, was 90.6% (n=1,453).

Phase Transition Success – By Disease Area Major disease areas were segmented according to the convention used by Biomedtracker and categorized into 21 major diseases and 623 indications for the 2011–2020 timeframe. For reporting at the disease area level, in Figure 2 we analyzed 14 major groupings: Allergy, Autoimmune, Cardiovascular, Endocrine, Gastroenterology (non-IBD), Hematology, Infectious disease, Metabolic, Neurology, Oncology, Ophthalmology, Psychiatry, Respiratory, and Urology. The remaining disease areas were placed into the “Other” category. This includes Dermatology, Renal, Obstetrics, Rheumatology (for non-autoimmune indications), ENT/Dental, and Orthopedics. Beneath these major disease areas are 573 indications, which will be analyzed and discussed in subsequent reports.

As seen in Figure 4, the Phase III success rates for the remaining 13 specific disease areas were each above 50%. Five other disease groups besides Oncology ranked below the average Phase III transition success rate of 57.8%, including Ophthalmology (51.2%, n=82) which in the earlier phases performed better than the average across all diseases. Conversely, Urology, which had the lowest transition rates in Phase I and II, had the second-highest Phase III success rate behind Hematology at 69.2%, albeit with a very low n of 13 transitions. All of the disease groups with below-average Phase III success rates had disease indications with large patient populations. Later in this report, we will analyze these high prevalence diseases and compare their success rates to those of therapies for rare diseases. 9/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Phase III transition success rates by disease area Figure 4: Phase III transition success rates by disease area. Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 NDA/BLA Submission Success Rates NDA/BLA transition success rates (approval rates) for the major disease areas ranged from the low end of 82.5% (Cardiovascular) to a high of 100.0% (Allergy). This distribution had the tightest range among the four phases analyzed in this report. These rates are the result of eventual success, not success on the first review. In some cases, programs have more than two Complete Response Letters (CRLs) and attempts at approval. This unlimited allowance of submission attempts pushes the overall success above 90.6% across all diseases, with only 137 drugs suspended by their sponsors at the regulatory transition over 2011–2020 (thus, 1,316 approved). Among the clinical development programs analyzed, there was an approximately even split of innovative drugs and non-originator products that were successful in obtaining regulatory approval. These included 740 innovative drug programs (435 new molecular entities (NMEs), 278 new biologics, and 27 vaccines) and 576 non-originator products (453 non-NMEs and 123 biosimilars). There is a more detailed discussion about success rates by for drug modality and classification later in the report. Likelihood of Approval (LOA) – By Disease Area One of the key measures of success used in this report is the LOA from Phase I. The LOA success rate is simply a multiplication of success rates from all four phases, a compounded probability calculation. For example, if each phase had a 50% chance of success, then the LOA from Phase I would be 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 6.25%. 76.8% 69.2% 66.2% 65.3% 64.7% 64.5% 64.0% 63.6% 60.0% 57.8% 57.1% 56.3% 55.2% 53.1% 51.2% 47.7% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% Hematology Urology Endocrine Autoimmune Allergy Respiratory Infectious disease Metabolic Others All indications Gastroenterology Psychiatry Cardiovascular Neurology Ophthalmology Oncology Probability of Success Probability of Phase III Success 10/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Multiplying the individual phase probabilities across all disease areas (found in Figure 1), the compounded probability of progressing from Phase I to U.S. FDA approval reveals that only 7.9% of drug development programs (n=12,728) successfully make it to market. As can be seen in Figure 5, there is a wide range of LOAs from Phase I. At the high end, Hematology towers over the other disease groups at 23.9% (n=352). Hematology therapies had an LOA from Phase I seven times higher than Urology therapies, which had the lowest Phase I LOA of all the major disease areas (3.6%, n=88). After Hematology, the next highest LOA from Phase I was Metabolic with 15.5% (n=399). Five other disease areas were above the overall average of 7.9% (Infectious Disease > Ophthalmology > Autoimmune > Allergy > Gastroenterology) which ranged from 13.2% down to 8.3%.

Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 Oncology and Non-Oncology Diseases Oncology drug development program transitions in the 2011–2020 period accounted for 33% of the 12,728 total transitions. With the third-lowest LOA from Phase I (5.3%, n=4,179), Oncology had an outsized effect on the overall industry success rate. To further understand this contribution, we compared phase transition success rates and LOA for non-oncology development programs against oncology development programs (Figure 6). The LOA from Phase I across non-oncology indications, 9.3% (n=8,549), was nearly twice that for Oncology alone, at 5.3% (n=4,179). Comparing individual phase transition success rates in Figure 2, Oncology consistently had one of the lowest success rates compared to the other 14 disease categories for every developmental clinical transition. In particular, there were relative differentials of approximately 20% between Oncology and non-oncology groupings at the Phase II and III stages. One notable exception was the NDA/BLA to approval success rate. Oncology performed slightly better than non-oncology at the regulatory transition between NDA/BLA and approval, with a 92.0% (n=324) success rate, as opposed to 90.2% (n=1,129). 12/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.)

Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 Oncology drugs were further categorized into two main types of cancer: solid tumors and hematologic cancers. Drugs for solid tumors had more than twice as many transitions in the data set (2,982 vs 1,094), but a much smaller LOA from Phase I vs hematological cancers (4.6% vs 7.5%). The 2011–2020 time period witnessed the rise of drugs that harness the immune system to treat the underlying cancer, spanning both solid and hematologic types. The first successful immuno-oncology (IO) drugs spawned intense growth in this field over a short period of time, with 679 total phase transitions included in the Biomedtracker database. The success rates of IO drugs far exceed the traditional oncology averages, with a Phase I LOA of 12.4%. The notably high Phase II transition rate of 42.0% for IO drugs – contrasting 24.6% as a whole for oncology – is the main factor underpinning the overall LOA success for the IO class.

Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 Rare and Chronic High Prevalence Diseases Within the Biomedtracker database, rare diseases can be identified based on meeting either or both of the following standard criteria: affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the US, or prevalence of 1 in 2,000 people in the EU. As 43% of the Oncology transitions are for rare indications, all Oncology indications were removed to make this rare disease analysis more concentrated on inborn genetic disorders. For chronic diseases, we first obtained a list of conditions from the CMS Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (CCW).

Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 After identifying programs for non-oncology rare diseases and highly prevalent chronic diseases, we compared their phase transition success rates and LOA as shown in Figure 8. At 17.0%, the overall LOA from Phase I for rare diseases (17.0%) was almost three times higher than for chronic, high prevalence diseases (5.9%). As both of these groups exclude Oncology indications, we can compare these results with those of the overall non-oncology figures. The 9.3% LOA (n=8,549) value for all non-oncology indications is meaningfully higher than for chronic, high prevalence diseases, suggesting that these indications are having a negative impact on overall success rates outside Oncology. Chronic, high prevalence diseases accounted for 16% of total transitions, with Oncology providing a further 33%. These two groups, having LOAs well below average, together comprise half of the total dataset, thus negatively affecting the overall industry LOA of 7.9%. Although excluded from the above analysis, rare disease Oncology indications had a higher LOA than non-rare Oncology indications (6.8% vs 4.4%), largely driven by the higher overall success for hematologic malignancies. Blood cancers typically have lower prevalence and are classified as rare diseases. Success rates for all four transitions were higher for the rare disease group than any of the overall transition success rates. The largest difference was found in Phase II transition success rates (44.6% for rare disease vs 28.9% overall). There was also a notable gap between Phase I transition rates (67.4% vs 52.0%), although success in Phase III and in the NDA/BLA to Approval transitions were broadly comparable. Conversely, the success rates for transitions in the highly prevalent chronic disease group were lower than the overall transition success rates in Phase I (46.0% vs 52.0%) and Phase II (23.1% vs 28.9%). The opposite was seen in Phase III and NDA/BLA transitions, where slightly higher success rates were observed: 59.5% vs 57.8% for Phase III and 92.6% vs 90.6% for NDA/BLA. 15/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Drug Classes and Modalities Drugs in the dataset were annotated as novel or off-patent, with the novel category including new molecular entities (NMEs; mainly small molecules), biologics, and vaccines; and the off-patent group comprised of non-NMEs and biosimilars. As noted in Figure 9, transition success rates for novel drugs confirm that they face a more difficult pathway to approval than for off-patent products. The overall Phase I LOA for off- patent therapies (14.7%, n=2,161) was twice as high as that for novel therapies (6.8%, n=10,527).This two-fold increase in success for non-originator products was driven by higher success rates in all three clinical phase transitions, with the greatest divergence observed during Phase III (52.9% vs 70.3%). Within the novel drugs segment, NMEs had a lower probability of approval from Phase I than either biologics or vaccines. While there was a 5.7% (n=6,803) chance of a Phase I NME gaining approval, the probabilities for biologics and vaccines were 9.1% (n=3,412) and 9.7% (n=312), respectively. Vaccines in particular have been 100% successful in the NDA/BLA to Approval stage (n=27). In the off-patent category, biosimilars performed well, with an overall Phase I LOA of 32.3% (n=277).

Looking a little deeper into drug modality, chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) development has seen the most success among selected novel modalities ( Figure 10). At 17.3% (n=67), the Phase I LOA for CAR-T therapies is more than twice the 7.9% average across all diseases, and more than three times higher than the 5.3% Phase I LOA for all of oncology. Since 2017, three separate CAR-Ts have gained approval, with a total of four successful BLA transitions. The strong R&D progress in RNA interference (RNAi) therapies is reflected in the Phase I LOA for this category, second behind CAR-T at 13.5% (n=70). This class includes three approvals as of December 31, 2020, the first of which came in 2018. Monoclonal antibodies, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), and gene therapies also each have over a 10% likelihood of approval at the Phase I stage.

Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 Patient Preselection Biomarkers A greater understanding of human disease – whether at the molecular or genomic level – ultimately leads to the investigation of personalized medicine. Indications are increasingly segmented by biomarkers in order to match patients with the treatments most likely to show the greatest benefit, according to the underlying drug mechanism and disease pathophysiology. We identified 767 phase transitions out of 12,728 (6%) that incorporated patient preselection biomarkers in their corresponding clinical trial design. This was accomplished by mapping Informa Pharma Intelligence’s Biomedtracker and Trialtrove databases, to provide the supplemental level of clinical trial detail. For a detailed description please refer to the Methods section. The LOA from Phase I segmented by biomarkers can be found in Figure 11. Drug development programs with trials employing patient preselection biomarkers have a two-fold higher LOA (15.9%) than those that do not (7.6%). 18/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.)

Source: Biomedtracker®, Pharmapremia®, and Trialtrove®, 2020 The advantage of patient preselection biomarkers varies according to the trial stage. At Phase I, there is no discernible difference between the two discrete sets, with both biomarker and non-biomarker programs achieving close to the average success rate of 52.0%. The benefit is clearly greatest at Phase II, where the use of preselection biomarkers enables 46.3% of programs to advance (n=149), compared to just 28.3% of those without. A similar advantage, albeit smaller in magnitude, is also observed with Phase III transitions – 68.2% for biomarker-supported programs vs 57.1% for those without. Success at the NDA/BLA transition is largely contingent on Phase III trial design and so this benefit carries over from the largest clinical phase. While this analysis only represents a small subset of the overall data, the degree of difference between individual phase success rates and overall LOA from Phase I builds confidence in the pursuit of drug development programs targeted at biomarker-enriched patient populations. Such assets are likely to advance through clinical development with lower levels of attrition, and should in theory improve patient outcomes via the advent of increasingly personalized medicine. 52.4% 46.3% 68.2% 96.0% 15.9% 52.0% 28.3% 57.1% 90.3% 7.6% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Phase I to II Phase II to III Phase III to NDA/BLA NDA/BLA to Approval Phase I to Approval Probability of Success Probability of Success: Preselection Biomarkers Preselection biomarkers No biomarkers 19/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.)

Part 2. Predictive Analysis of Clinical Success In Part 1, we estimated success rates using the drug-indication pathways gathered from the Biomedtracker database. We can now incorporate additional information, called “features,” for each drug development program using machine learning methods to produce forward-looking measures—forecasts—of the outcome of ongoing programs. This type of analysis provides more timely and relevant estimates than standalone analyses of historical success rates. Some examples of features included in this predictive analysis are the characteristics of the drug, its indication, its sponsor, and its clinical trial design. There are more than 200 features used in the QLS forecasts, a sample of which can be found in Figure 12. In much the same way that linear regression models employ regressors, or “right-hand-side” variables, to predict the “left-hand-side” or the dependent variable, these features contain useful signals about drug development that allow the outcomes of drug development programs to be more accurately predicted than before. Sample of the 200-plus features driving success rate probabilities Figure 12: Sample of the 200-plus features extracted from Pharmaprojects, Trialtrove, and Biomedtracker. The QLS approach uses state of the art machine-learning techniques to analyze clinical trial data. While the details of the QLS model are proprietary, an example of a commonly used machine-learning algorithm is a random forest classifier. The random forest classifier is an algorithm that takes the average prediction from a multitude of yes-no decision trees (i.e., a “forest”) that are applied to the features (see Figure 13). When training a decision tree, one task is to learn the most informative questions to ask at each branch point of the tree. For example, the algorithm might ask, “Is the drug sponsor a big pharma company?” If the answer is “yes,” then the algorithm would move to the “yes” branch of the decision tree and then ask, “Is the trial double-blind?” On the other hand, if the answer is “no,” then the algorithm would move to the “no” branch of the decision tree, and ask, “Is the drug a small molecule?” and so on, until enough information has been collected about the drug-program to make a prediction about its success or failure. By identifying subtle patterns in a large enough database of historical drug transitions, machine-learning algorithms can often make remarkably accurate predictions. Additional details on these techniques can be found in the Methodology section. Figure 13: A hypothetical representation of a single, simplified decision tree. The percentages at the “leaves” of the tree denote the fraction of training data samples that are categorized by a given pathway. 20/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Feature Importance Given the stakes involved in the drug development process, machine learning forecasts must not only be accurate, but also interpretable to stakeholders charged with the responsibility of making go/no-go decisions. These decision-makers need to understand why a given forecast differs from the historical average, and which features were most important in driving the difference or delta with respect to the disease-group baseline LOA. To increase the transparency of our forecasts, the QLS machine learning algorithm reports the most important features and their individual contributions to the forecast’s delta. As an illustration, we decompose our probability of approval (POA) prediction of an oncology drug that is currently in phase 3 clinical trials into its key components. (Note that we use the term POA for the QLS machine-learning forecasts to differentiate from the empirical “LOA” presented in Part I.) Figure 14 reports the top five features that increase this program’s estimated probability of approval from its therapeutic area historical baseline of 35.0% from phase 3 to approval, to 71.8%. The top positive feature driving this higher than average probability is its breakthrough therapy designation (+20.6%). This designation is granted when the FDA has determined that preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial clinical improvement over available therapies. Further positive clinical evidence in phase 2 increases the estimate by an additional +6.4%. Next, because it is a PARP inhibitor (+4.6%) that has been previously approved for another indication (+3.6%), the POA is augmented by an additional 8.2%. Finally, its treatment of a solid tumor type (-2.0%) and the net aggregate contribution of other features (-2.8%) penalize the overall POA score slightly. Example of probability decomposition Figure 14: Decomposition of the probability of approval estimate for an anti-cancer drug that is currently in phase 3 clinical trials for prostate cancer. The top five features that increase this program’s estimated probability of approval from the historical phase 3 to approval baseline in oncology of 35.0% to 71.8% are reported.

Although each individual prediction may have unique drivers, we can also extract the most informative variables across all predictions to gain insight into some of the most common predictors of success.

Source: QLS Advisors. The indication was consistently ranked the top variable across all clinical development phases. Indeed, success rates vary substantially across indications even within a therapeutic area. For example, in oncology, the overall phase 1 to approval LOA ranges from a minimum of 1.1% (n=275) for pancreatic cancer to a maximum of 15.2% (n=33) for alimentary cancers. We also observe that lead indication status, prior approval of a drug for another indication, and biological target validation all have a significant impact on the probability of approval. In some cases, developing an already approved drug for a new indication—one that has a controlled manufacturing process, and has already been shown to be safe in humans—has a greater likelihood of success than a novel indication. In other cases, the success rates for lead indications may be higher if a sponsor initiates clinical trials for multiple follow-on indications for which the drug was not originally intended, and many of the initiated clinical trials for the same drug fail. Analysis showed that the trial outcome (whether the trial was completed, with its primary endpoints met) has significant associations with late-stage clinical success. It is easy to imagine that a drug-indication pair whose trial failed to meet its endpoints has a low probability of success in advancing to approval. For example, as of December 31, 2020, our algorithm predicts that one specific BLA for Alzheimer’s disease has only a 65% chance of progressing from regulatory review to approval, even though historically 83% of neurology drugs have made the transition to approval once they have reached this stage. The observation that the biologic failed to meet its primary endpoints in phase 3 is the top contributor (-15%) to this adjustment from the 22/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) baseline. In contrast, candidates that achieve positive outcomes have a higher probability of success. The use of patient pre-selection biomarkers in clinical trials has become more common, and it has been reported that trials using biomarkers are more likely to succeed. 3 Consistent with these findings, Figure 15 shows that the use of patient pre-selection biomarkers has an important impact on success rates. For example, in the past decade, the number of non-targeted therapies in oncology has declined, while the use of targeted agents and pre-selection biomarkers has risen dramatically. Between 2016 and 2020, 85% (n=136) of oncology approvals were targeted agents. Moreover, 37% (n=51) involved either pre-selection against a driver mutation (26%; n=36) or pre-selection using a tumor-specific antigen (11%; n=15). In Figure 15, drug modality can be seen as another important predictor of success. As an illustrative example, monoclonal antibodies have had higher phase-1-to-approval success rates (5.9%; n=935) than other modalities within oncology. Moreover, immunotherapies focused on PD-1 or PD-L1 have been tremendously successful from phase I (23.9%; n=71). In contrast, other immunotherapies, while numerous, have been much more likely to result in failure from phase I (1.9%; n=945). Finally, we find that sponsor track record, quantified by the number of previous successful phase transitions in a given therapeutic area, is also a useful indicator for clinical program predictions. The positive correlation between track record and future success is likely associated with operational experience in conducting clinical trials and navigating the regulatory review process.

Higher forecasts are associated with higher rates of approval, which indicates positive forecast power. Estimates for each phase are grouped into quintiles. However, the results also demonstrate that these predictions are by no means perfect. There is considerable noise in these estimates. In certain cases, our model tends to slightly underestimate the approval rates in the most recent out-of-sample period. For example, success rates in oncology have been increasing, concurrently with the emergence of genomic technologies, an improved scientific understanding of cancer biology and ways to disrupt cancer cells, as well as an evolving regulatory environment that includes a higher number of accelerated approvals. As we incorporate more data, more features, and the latest scientific and medical knowledge into the algorithm, these forecasts will improve, which will occur naturally over time as these methods become more popular. The QLS model is trained on the full dataset, which includes the most recent development programs and approvals. 24/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Part 3. Drug Development Timelines In addition to determining whether drugs are advanced or suspended at the end of a phase transition, the Biomedtracker and Pharmapremia data can also be analyzed to yield time spent at each clinical stage, and overall drug development timelines. These are valuable metrics as there are considerable opportunity costs associated with investing in an R&D process that may take up to a decade, and a simple analysis of clinical trial durations excludes the contribution of internal decision making and strategic execution from the overall timeline. Based on 6,151 successful phase transitions over the 2011–2020 period, it took an average of 10.5 years for a drug to successfully progress from Phase I development to regulatory approval. This includes 2.3 years at Phase I, 3.6 years at Phase II, 3.3 years at Phase III, and 1.3 years at the regulatory stage. Phase duration can vary greatly according to numerous factors, such as disease area and indication, best practices of clinical trial design, and patient availability. Accordingly, Figure 17 evaluates drug development timelines for the major 14 categorized disease areas. Disease areas with above-average LOAs tend to be associated with shorter development timelines. Five of the seven best-performing disease areas by LOA fall beneath the 10.5-year average development duration, including all four groups with a duration of less than 10 years (Allergy, Metabolic, Infectious disease, and Ophthalmology). Conversely, the remaining disease areas, with below average LOAs, either have durations that lie very close to the 10.5-year average duration, or in the case of Urology, Cardiovascular and Neurology, notably exceed the average.

The n value is the total ‘Advanced’ transitions within each phase used to calculate duration. The ordering of disease areas is equivalent to the total years overall in clinical development. Source: Biomedtracker® and Pharmapremia®, 2020 Within each individual phase, there are some noteworthy performers. Oncology shares the longest Phase I transition at 2.7 years with Urology, but it is remarkably close to the Phase II and III averages with durations of 3.7 and 3.1 years, respectively. It is also the only disease area to have an average regulatory review of less than 1 year; the 0.8-year duration is almost half as short as the cumulative total for all non-Oncology indications (1.4 years). Urology drug candidates experience the longest Phase II transition (5.0 years), although this average is calculated from a sample size of just six. Excluding Urology, the remaining disease areas all lie close to the average transition of 3.6 years. Ophthalmology emerges as the fastest disease area for Phase II research (2.9 years). When looking at Phase III timelines, Cardiovascular drug programs have the longest duration, extending to 4.2 years. The large cardiovascular patient population sizes in trials and the long-term evaluation of cardiovascular outcomes contribute to longer timelines than seen in other highly prevalent diseases, such as Psychiatry (2.8 years), which typically assesses short-term symptomatic improvement using rating-scale questionnaires. 26/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Discussion Comparison with previous reports on attrition rates In 2016, BIO published a major report on industry attrition rates using Biomedtracker’s data from 2006 to 2015 for 9,985 phase transitions, revealing an overall LOA of 9.6% for an asset entering Phase I development. This report analyzed 12,728 transitions from 2011 to 2020 and revealed a lower overall LOA of 7.9%. While the underlying data and analyses are consistent, we caution against direct comparison between the two top- line LOA numbers. Among the additional ~2,750 phase transitions in this analysis, a sizable portion can be attributed to industry expansion, with more companies (1,779 vs 1,103) and a larger pipeline (9,704 programs vs 7,455) in the dataset. Additionally, increased demand from investors for disclosures on drug pipeline progress has resulted in timelier reporting of suspended programs. Furthermore, the time period examined in this report includes more rigorous scrutiny of the Biomedtracker database. The result is a stronger account of failed transitions in the 2011–2020 analysis vs the 2006–2015 analysis. In particular, this has resulted in a notable correction in the calculation of success rates for the Phase I transition, where drugs can lie dormant or unreported for many years, lowering the success rate from 63.2% during 2006–2015 to 52.0% in 2011–2020. Transition rates at Phase II and III are closer, albeit slightly lower in this update (28.9% vs 30.7%; 57.8% vs 58.1%).

Disease areas ranked by the latest LOA results from high to low. See Appendix for a breakdown of individual phase success rates The observations and takeaways of the 2016 report remains as relevant today as they did in 2016, even accounting for the changes from these improved calculations. The leading factors that correlate with higher success rates remain consistent: clinical validation of a target (e.g., whether a drug with the same mechanism of action has been previously approved), biologic modality (e.g., mAbs), patient population and selection strategy (e.g., rare diseases with detectable gene mutations). 27/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) Oncology: largest segment of industry, modest success rates Oncology continues to possess the largest portion of the 12,728 phase transitions over 2011–2020, even though it has the lowest Phase I LOA (5.3%). Despite our caution against direct comparisons with the 2016 paper, Oncology was one of the few major disease areas to increase its LOA, growing marginally from 5.1% in the previous analysis. In addition to the emergence of IO therapeutics, other drivers of improved success may be due to an increase in biomarker-defined patient populations, and the success of novel drug modalities (CAR-T, ADCs, etc.). That being said, the overall performance of Oncology is still considerably below the industry average (7.9%) and non-oncology indications (9.3%). There is also no substantial benefit to many Oncology indications being classified as rare diseases, as the rare Oncology subset only carries a Phase I LOA of 6.8%. These findings indicate that scientific complexity and the competitive dynamic that characterize this therapy area continue to have an adverse impact on the success rates for oncology therapies. This has not dissuaded investment within Oncology, with nearly half of all venture capital going into cancer companies by the end of the last decade.4 Challenges for Phase II proof-of-concept drive overall performance The Phase II transition is clearly the main translational and limiting step from bench to bedside, as proof-of- concept is only established in 28.9% of drug programs at this stage. Phase II also sees the greatest distribution between major disease areas, with a three-fold difference spanning Urology (15.0%) and Hematology (48.1%) at opposite ends of the spectrum. Within these disease areas, it is the performance of “novel” drug classes – NMEs (New Molecular Entities), biologics, and vaccines – that have the most significant negative contribution to low overall LOA success rates, as the “off-patent” grouping relies on duplication of established science. Hematology retains a dominant position largely on the strength of hemophilia research, which accounts for the largest number of transitions within the disease area. In the case of hemophilia A, where the underlying biology is extremely well characterized, 32 of 34 of phase transitions have been successful, including all six at Phase II development. The other main hematologic disease, anemia (which includes several different sub- indications), also has notably above-average success rates. Conversely, Cardiovascular saw a large numbers of failed Phase II transitions for novel drug candidates, with an overall rate of just 21.0%. Compared to the other major disease areas such as Oncology and Autoimmune, there is relatively little penetration of biologics within Cardiovascular, where novel drug discovery is commonly centered on oral small molecules. Of the 507 Cardiovascular development programs in the Biomedtracker dataset, there are just 98 biologics vs 321 NMEs. This approximate 1:3 ratio is far lower than Autoimmune therapies which have a ratio of 1:1 and a LOA of 10.7%. As noted in Figure 9, NMEs underperform biologics considerably, including at the critical Phase II transition. For biologics, there is typically a stronger relationship between disease state and drug mechanism, enabling a stronger proof-of-concept. Neurology is an interesting example where the Phase II transition rate (26.8%) is relatively close to the industry average, with most of the developmental risk realized later in Phase III studies. Clinical development programs for neurodegenerative diseases are often able (or designed) to find adequate justification from biomarker data to progress into late-stage trials, without having a clinical proof-of-concept on clinically validated endpoints. The resulting effect is underperformance in the Phase III and NDA/BLA transitions, dragging down the overall Phase I to LOA success rate for this disease category to 5.9% Characteristics of"}

Specific examples of clinical and commercial successes have encouraged this transition. Drivers of these successes include targeting molecularly defined causes of disease, regulatory incentives, and favorable reimbursement environments. However, as these drivers of success are absent from chronic, highly prevalent diseases, investment for these indications has waned over the same period, with notable 4 BIO (2020) Emerging Therapeutic Company Investment and Deal Trends.

BIO has covered the state of innovation in these areas in a series of industry analysis reports.6,7,8 One large difference between this 2011–2020 dataset and the previous 2006–2015 iteration is the intensifying focus on rare diseases. Our latest analysis includes 1,256 phase transitions within rare diseases, a considerable increase over the 521 noted in the previous study. This spans 685 different lead developers (not including those listed solely as partners). This indicates that companies view pivoting to rare disease clinical development as a sound strategy. While notably more successful than industry averages – and in particular chronic, highly prevalent diseases – the increasing breadth of rare disease R&D is leading to a reduction in overall success. Our calculated Phase I LOA of 17.0%, slightly over double the industry average (7.9%), represents a notable fall from the 25.3% reported in 2016. As the number of programs has grown, so has the number of rare diseases that are being addressed for the first time by therapeutic modalities where less is known about their biology and pathology. In other cases, there are new difficulties in targeting the root cause. Nevertheless, rare disease R&D remains an attractive area for investment, combining a large unmet need with commercial potential, supported by regulatory incentives and above-average clinical success rates. Complexity of modality correlates with higher LOA As an approximate rule, the increasing chemical complexity of the therapeutic being tested is associated with higher rates of phase success, as shown in Figure 10. In the past ten years the proportion of complex biologics in the clinical pipeline has steadily expanded from 25% to 40%. 9 However, this trend has not been enough to boost overall industry rates beyond a 10% LOA, as simpler small molecules remain the in the majority. These account for 57% of the 12,728 phase transitions included in this analysis, with a modest 7.5% Phase I LOA. Monoclonal antibodies, which entered routine clinical practice three decades ago, have considerably improved LOAs (12.1%) when compared to the drug classes that came before – small molecules (7.5%), peptides (8.0%), and proteins (9.4%). Since then, numerous new classes have emerged that have not yet had a comparable transformational impact, including gene therapies and antibody-drug conjugates. However, recent advances with CAR-T cell therapies and RNA interference are yielding industry-leading LOAs of 17.3% and 13.5%, respectively. Advanced biologic therapies possess the intrinsic benefit of being precise tools for manipulating human biology and are reserved for indications where there is a clear pathophysiology. Additionally, they are also more likely to benefit indirectly by association with other factors that are highly predictive of success, including regulatory designation, biomarker-enriched patient populations, and reduced competition. On the last point, commercial maturity is one important factor that leads to pipeline attrition. Investment decisions and portfolio prioritization reflect the competitive scenario, so we should realistically expect strategic and clinical suspensions to increase over time. It will be interesting to see whether CAR-T and RNA interference approaches can sustain such remarkable LOAs as fast-followers enter the clinic and attempt to extend the technology into new, unproven treatment settings. Success rates can eventually wane over time as sample sizes increases.

More accurate forecasts mean fewer drug failures, faster approval times, a lower cost of capital, and more funding available to bring new and better therapies to patients sooner. When managing their portfolios of investigational drugs, biopharma companies typically use simple historical averages of regulatory approval rates, based on backward-looking relative frequencies of approval. While these historical averages contain useful insights, they do not take into account the many important predictive features related to therapeutic modality, trial design, sponsor track record, or other characteristics specific to the indication. Drug and device developers need to be able to accurately evaluate the impact of key drivers on the probability of success to efficiently allocate capital to opportunities with the highest potential. In this report, we demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to fully exploit all available data. The relative importance of individual features in our predictive models find that trial outcome, regulatory designation, prior approval for another indication, the use of patient pre-selection biomarkers, drug modality, and sponsor track record are all critical features for predicting success in our set of more than 200 features. Because these classifiers are nonlinear, there is no simple interpretation of the contribution of each predictor to the forecast. However, the intuition behind some of these factors is clear. For example, drug-indication pairs with trials that achieve positive outcomes should have a greater chance of approval; candidates sponsored by companies with strong track records and diverse expertise in drug development should have a higher likelihood of success; and already approved drugs should have higher chances of approval for a second related indication. When applied to out-of-sample data, the QLS forecasts show that candidates with higher probabilities were indeed more likely to be approved, indicating that our models are able to discriminate between high- and low-probability candidates. These promising results suggest the possibility of even more powerful predictive models with the inclusion of more refined drug development data, including patient-level clinical trial data. Ultimately, such predictive analytics have the potential to facilitate more informed data-driven decisions about the risk assessment and portfolio management of investigational drugs at all clinical stages. Increasing duration in clinical development typically carries an elevated risk The average timeline from Phase I to approval over 2011–2020 was 10.5 years. This lengthy timeframe is a significant risk to investors and entrepreneurs, and speaks to the current complexities of today’s clinical drug development. This risk is compounded with the correlation of longer timelines in certain disease areas with greater pipeline attrition rates. For example, Urology and Cardiovascular carry both the longest clinical program durations (12.2 years and 11.5 years) and the lowest LOAs from Phase I (3.6% and 4.8%). This may partly be attributed to highly prevalent diseases requiring longer enrollment times and more complex endpoints. The average time to run an Alzheimer’s Phase II trial is not going to be a short as a Phase II trial for a Covid-19 antibody. However, for some of the more complex diseases, the failure to terminate R&D programs when the data do not support further progression can add significantly to the duration recorded for a particular phase. There are countless examples of studies yielding inconclusive results, necessitating further clinical investigation and prolonging the duration within a given phase, only for the drug to subsequently fail again. Oncology timelines were found to have unique characteristics. Although the overall oncology development time is close to the average (10.3 years vs 10.5 years), the length of each constituent phase varies considerably from the average. Its Phase I duration (2.7 years) is the longest of all major disease areas, while its NDA/ BLA filing transition is the shortest (0.8 years). Oncology drug developers have broadly adopted the basket trial design at Phase I, whereby multiple different indications are studied in a single trial to evaluate potential efficacy signals, before expansion cohorts are initiated, either within the same trial or in a new Phase II study. At the US FDA, the Office of Oncologic Diseases in particular has led the use of expedited pathways and predictive endpoints, as well as Real Time Oncology Review (RTOR), facilitating the transition of new cancer drugs that address unmet clinical needs. 30/ February 2021 ©"}

Methods Drug Development Programs analyzed in this report track a specific indication for each drug. For example, Rituxan in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) qualifies as a different development path than Rituxan in multiple sclerosis (MS). Biomedtracker assigns a unique internal identifier that can be used to isolate all development paths. In addition to tracking the phase of development, Biomedtracker also assigns “lead” status to certain development paths. This is used to denote the most advanced indication in clinical development for a specific drug. Drugs can only have one lead development program (with some rare exceptions). For example, cancer drugs developed in multiple indications will have the most advanced program assigned as the lead, and the rest as “non-lead”. However, in this report we do not differentiate the most advanced programs and analyze the data on a program/development path level, which more accurately reflects company resource utilization. Individual Phase Transition Success Rates were calculated as the number of drugs that moved from one phase to the next phase divided by the sum of the number of drugs that progressed to the next phase and the number of drugs that were suspended. The n value associated with the phase transition success rates represents the number of drugs that have advanced plus the number of drugs that have been suspended, which we label as phase transitions. Phase transition success rates reported in this study were based on transition rates, not necessarily resulting from safety or efficacy data. Transition rates are negatively impacted by early development termination due to commercial and regulatory uncertainty as well as economic and portfolio management decisions. Biomedtracker further classifies events by phase of development, summarized in the table below: Generic products were not included, but generic manufacturers developing novel investigational drugs were represented. Biosimilars, which require thorough clinical development, were also included. Likelihood of Approval (LOA) denotes the probability of reaching FDA approval from the current phase and is also expressed as a percentage. LOA is calculated as the product of each phase success probability leading to FDA approval. The n value associated with LOA is the sum of the n values for each phase transition included in the LOA calculation. For example, if a drug is currently in Phase II, and the phase success for Phase II is 50% (n=10), Phase III is 50% (n=10), and FDA approval is 50% (n=10), then the LOA for the Phase II drug would be 12.5% (50%×50%×50%=12.5%, n=30). Data Source for Drug Program Transitions. Data used for this study were extracted from Biomedtracker 31/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) using Pharmapremia, a purpose-built Probability of Technical Success (PTS) tool, which identified all ‘Advanced’ and ‘Suspended’ drugs by development phase from January 1, 2011, to November 30, 2020. Biomedtracker and Pharmapremia, subscription-based products of Informa, track the clinical development and regulatory history of investigational drugs to assess their Likelihood of Approval (LOA) by the FDA. Biomedtracker is populated in near real-time with updated information from press releases, corporate earnings calls, investor and medical meetings, and numerous other sources. These data are recorded in Biomedtracker and tagged with a date. Biomedtracker also uses other sources, including regular communication with companies conducting clinical trials, to enhance the accuracy and timeliness of the data. Drug Classification Methods. Biomedtracker records FDA classification (i.e., new molecular entity (NME), non-NME, biologic, or vaccine) as well as the biochemical profile (e.g., small molecule, monoclonal antibody, peptides, natural proteins, antisense, vaccine, etc.). Biologics, as defined by the FDA, can be sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids, or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and tissues. Patient Preselection Biomarkers. A subset of the Biomedtracker phase transition data was matched with corresponding entries in Trialtrove, an analyst-curated clinical trial database produced by Informa Pharma Intelligence. Where available, NCT numbers (ClinicalTrials.gov) from Biomedtracker for each drug-indication pair was matched according to the corresponding entry in Trialtrove, which contains additional information on whether patient preselection biomarkers featured in the trial design. This includes trials incorporating pharmacogenomic and/or pharmacogenetic analysis, including the use of genomic biomarkers (RNA, DNA) for patient selection or stratification.

NDA/ BLA transitions were assumed to feature patient preselection biomarker data if the Phase III transitions qualified as such. Drug Development Timelines. In addition to denoting whether a drug was advanced or suspended at the end of a phase, Pharmapremia also calculates the time spent at each clinical or regulatory phase for all successful transitions. Suspended program timelines were not included to assess timelines. This is the duration between public disclosures of the initiation of appropriate stages, and as such does not map exactly to clinical trial timings. Each clinical phase transition may encompass more than one clinical trial, which may or may not run sequentially. Furthermore, there may be an additional delay between planning development strategy, reporting of trial results, the decision to progress or suspend, and the public disclosure of this information. QLS Methodology. As in the case of estimating historical success rates, missing data is a significant challenge when applying machine-learning algorithms to predicting clinical trial outcomes. Gathering and filling in this missing data manually is expensive, time-consuming, susceptible to error, and, in many cases, simply not possible because the missing data no longer exist. A typical solution is to discard any clinical trials or drug-indication pathways with missing features. However, this approach eliminates a great deal of useful information, and can lead to biased inferences in the analysis. A more elegant solution involves replacing it with substituted values obtained through various imputation methods. One approach is a statistical technique called the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, in which the missing data are replaced with the average of the k “most similar” (i.e., closest) examples in the data set. For example, if one were replacing a square of missing bathroom tile, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm using a k of 8 would suggest the replacement tile should have the color average of the eight tiles surrounding the missing piece. Once the missing information has been imputed, the QLS approach uses a proprietary machine-learning algorithm to analyze the clinical trial data, including its additional features. While the details of the QLS model 32/ February 2021 © BIO | QLS Advisors | Informa UK Ltd 2021 (Unauthorized photocopying prohibited.) are proprietary, an example of a commonly used machine-learning algorithm is a random forest classifier. The motivation for a random forest is to aggregate the predictions of many different decision trees, each of which is trained over a randomized subset of variables (see figure below). While each individual tree is a weak predictor, their collective average forms a strong predictor, similar to the ‘wisdom of crowds’ that determines the market price of a financial asset. For example, consider a specific dataset of clinical trials in which the successful trials are more frequently associated with big pharma companies having three or more oncology drugs approved over the past five years, all of which were biologics rather than small molecules. The collection of decision trees that form a random forest might recognize this pattern and predict that a small biotech company with no previous drug approvals will have a lower probability of success than a company that more closely fit the profile described in the previous sentence. A “forest” of decision trees. Each individual tree is a weak predictor, but similar to the wisdom of crowds, their ensemble average forms a strong predictor. By identifying subtle patterns in a large enough database of historical drug transitions, machine-learning algorithms can often make remarkably accurate predictions.

They are used by oncologists to help guide clinical decision making. While overall survival (OS) has frequently been regarded as the “gold standard” primary clinical endpoint, it’s utility is constrained by several disadvantages. The time-con - suming nature of trials using OS has led to a recent push to explore surrogate clinical endpoints and their potential to serve as primary clinical endpoints in lieu of OS. Additionally, it is becoming evident that other endpoints add valuable information about quality of life and treatment failure as their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in on- cology clinical trials. Without a doubt, the use of clinical endpoints will continue to expand and evolve as new cancer therapies are developed and novel treatments, including immunotherapy, draw interest. This review explores the roles of primary and surrogate clinical endpoints as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each specific endpoint. In addition, it directly compares the unique features of each suggesting some of the specific uses each one fulfills. Keywords: Progression, treatment failure, overall survival, end point Introduction Clinical trials are critical to the development of medical interventions as they assess the safety and efficacy of each new approach. A clinical endpoint is an objective tool used to measure how beneficial a medical intervention is to a patient’s feeling, function, and survival. Clinical endpoints are used in clinical trials to assess validity and generalizability of the study, and the evidence they generate is important to clini- cians and patients alike. Clinical endpoints also have the capacity to evaluate the outcomes of using a medical intervention to guide clinical decision making. When addressing potential treatment options with a patient, physicians look for interventions that will improve survival, reduce symptoms, restore functional capacity, or lower the chances of developing a chronic condition. These desirable effects are weighed against any negative side effects or assumed risks. Since medical interventions can have a number of effects on a patient, it is important to use multiple endpoints to assess changes in clini - cal course that occur as a result of the inter- vention [1]. Additionally, the use of multiple endpoints allows a team to evaluate outcomes that will arise independently of intervention or that will be modified by intervention [1]. While non-clinical endpoints, such as biomarkers, are frequently utilized as objective measures of bio- logical processes, their use falls outside of the scope of this paper in which we will focus on clinical and surrogate endpoints. There are different ways to categorize clinical endpoints depending on the trial goals and objectives. Generally, clinical endpoints can be classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary depending on their relevance to the main research question. While primary endpoints are efficacy measures that address the question directly, secondary and tertiary endpoints may be utilized to dem - onstrate additional effects, support a mecha - nism of action, or explore less frequently occur- ring outcomes [1]. For example, a primary end - point in oncological clinical trials is usually sur - vival: a direct, measurable outcome based on the drug’s expected effects. A secondary end - point, such as quality of life, may be chosen to explore additional benefit the patient may gain including functional and emotional status. All other exploratory endpoints would be classified as tertiary endpoints. Oncology clinical endpoints 1122 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 There are many qualities a good primary clinical endpoint should have. Endpoints should be easy to measure either objectively or subjec - tively by a clinician, observer, or patient [2]. Most importantly, a primary clinical endpoint should have clinical relevance to the patient and directly measure a patient’s feelings, abili - ty to perform daily tasks, or survival [3]. Since choosing the wrong endpoint can make it diffi - cult to detect study outcomes, many trials uti - lize numerous endpoints which may have pri - mary or secondary significance [4]. Clinical tri - als also frequently rely on the utilization of sur - rogate endpoints to substitute for clinical end - points [5]. In the classical definition of surro - gate endpoints, they are referred to as “bio - markers”, however, not all biomarkers will meet the criteria to be surrogate endpoints [6]. In order for a biomarker to be considered a surro- gate endpoint, there must be a relationship between the biomarker and the clinical out - come; a mere association between the bio - marker and the pathophysiology of the disease is not sufficient [6]. If general information about the disease pathophysiology and the intervention’s mechanism of action, surrogate endpoints are expected to predict clinical ben - efit or harm [6]. While surrogate endpoints have historically been used to rapidly assess medi - cal interventions in clinical trials, they do not have strict validation criteria [6]. Alternatively, there exists a set of guidelines that provides a framework for understanding the evidence sur- rogate endpoints provide in a study [7]. Clinical endpoints can also be categorized as quantitative or qualitative depending on how the outcome is measured. Quantitative end - points are measured"}

Alternatively, there exists a set of guidelines that provides a framework for understanding the evidence sur- rogate endpoints provide in a study [7]. Clinical endpoints can also be categorized as quantitative or qualitative depending on how the outcome is measured. Quantitative end - points are measured objectively by the amount of time that has elapsed from randomization or treatment initiation to the desired event. In comparison, qualitative endpoints are mea - sured subjectively and are typically reported based on observations made by the patient, caregiver, or physician. The development of novel cancer treatments especially relies on clinical trials and the utilization of relevant clinical endpoints. In trials with cancer patients, it is also important to account for the different cancer types, histological subgroups, and life expectancy [8]. For example, while clinical end- points were traditionally reserved to evaluate therapies during phase III clinical trials, their use in early-phase clinical trials has become more frequent with the development of novel immunotherapies [9]. This paper will explore the benefits and drawbacks of using different clinical endpoints in clinical trials that assess the efficacy of new cancer treatments. Overall survival Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death [10]. Any patients lost to follow up or still alive at the time of evalua - tion are censored [11]. Since the goal of cancer treatment is generally to extend survival, OS is often referred to as the gold standard endpoint in oncology clinical trials [6]. OS is a patient- centered endpoint that is easy to measure; it is definite since the final time point is death [12]. Moreover, OS is objective, and researcher bias is unlikely to take place [13, 14]. While OS remains the preferred clinical endpoint in on- cology clinical trials, it has some drawbacks. Primarily, the expectation of long-term patient follow-up indicates a larger patient population is required and the study will require more financial support [15]. Additionally, OS has lim - ited use in diseases that are slowly progressing and have an expected long-term survival. In these cases, OS may be influenced by treat - ment in further steps, sequential use of other agents, and cross-over treatments, making it difficult to attribute the clinical endpoint to a specific medical intervention [4]. Additionally, as a primary clinical endpoint, OS can also be influenced by non-cancer deaths since the end- point is defined as time from randomization to death of any cause [10]. Progression-free survival and time to progres- sion Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization until first evidence of disease progression or death [10]. PFS is mea- sured by censoring and patients who are still alive at the time of evaluation or those who were lost to follow up [14]. PFS is a popular sur- rogate endpoints since fewer patients are needed to obtain the data that becomes avail - able early in the trial [14]. These factors often lead to early completion of clinical trials and reduced associated costs [13]. PFS also pro - vides the benefit of objective evaluation with - out being influenced by subsequent therapies or cross-overs [4]. PFS is an attractive choice in clinical endpoint for its direct information with Oncology clinical endpoints 1123 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 regards to drug activity and their rapid turn - around in data compared to OS. Additionally, PFS has drawn more attention as a clinical endpoint for its ability to assess treatment paradigms that include multi-stage therapies. Where OS fails to assess the short-term, incre - mental changes of each round of treatment, PFS can [16]. However, PFS’s use as a clinical endpoint is debatable because prolonged PFS does not always result in an extended survival [4]. Time to progression Time to progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization until first evidence of disease progression [15]. Since PFS and TTP are similar, it is important for studies to clarify what is meant by evidence of disease progres - sion. In advanced breast cancer, some in- vestigators use PFS and TTP interchangeably, potentially leading to confusion when com- paring the outcomes of various trials [17]. Meanwhile, studies have used TTP to evaluate aggressive therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, however, its use as a surro- gate marker is not definitive and it should be avoided as a primary endpoint [18]. The value of TTP’s assessment has the potential to be adversely affected by disease characteristics unique to each patient including inter-tumor variation and the tumor’s natural growth rate.

In advanced breast cancer, some in- vestigators use PFS and TTP interchangeably, potentially leading to confusion when com- paring the outcomes of various trials [17]. Meanwhile, studies have used TTP to evaluate aggressive therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, however, its use as a surro- gate marker is not definitive and it should be avoided as a primary endpoint [18]. The value of TTP’s assessment has the potential to be adversely affected by disease characteristics unique to each patient including inter-tumor variation and the tumor’s natural growth rate. In response, researchers have proposed a patient-personalized “TTP ratio” as an addition- al parameter to measure the effectiveness of targeted therapy [19]. This variant of TTP com - pares tumor growth both on and off treatment, serving as an intra-patient control for natural tumor growth rate [19]. Disease free survival Disease free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from randomization until evidence of dis - ease recurrence [4]. It is closely related to duration of response (DOR): the length of time a tumor will respond to treatment without growing or metastasizing [18]. While PFS is used as a clinical endpoint for treatments that are used to manage more advanced, metastat- ic malignancies, DFS is used as a clinical end - point for adjuvant treatments after definitive surgery or radiotherapy. Similar to PFS, DFS is a surrogate endpoint which requires a small- er patient number and shorter follow-up than other endpoints such as OS [4]. For this reason, DFS is often regarded as an important end- point for cancers with a prolonged OS [20]. The value of DFS has been contended by experts in the field for a number of reasons. Primarily, the definition of ‘disease-free interval’ continues to raise questions. Moreover, questions of the validity of an incidental finding of cancer regard- less of symptoms in such patients continue to be controversial [20]. For these reasons, it is increasingly important that recurrence be defined when utilizing DFS as a clinical end - point. Despite its draw backs, DFS has been used as a strong surrogate endpoint for OS in clinical trials for stage III colon cancer, in an adjuvant setting in lung cancer, and in breast cancer [21-23]. Event-free survival Event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from randomization to an event which may include disease progression, discontinuation of the treatment for any reason, or death [24]. While EFS and DFS used to be interchangeable, the patient is not technically “disease-free” at the time of randomization in a neoadjuvant set- ting; EFS is now the clinical endpoint reserved for neoadjuvant settings while DFS is applied in adjuvant settings [24]. EFS is a surrogate endpoint that can be used in the place of a pri- mary endpoint, such as OS, to reduce sample size, costs, and duration of follow-up [25]. Since EFS is a surrogate endpoint, it needs to be validated for each unique tumor type, treat - ment, and stage of disease. Studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been used to evaluate EFS’s strength as a surrogate end - point [25, 26]. One of the benefits of using EFS over OS in cases of AML is that it is not depen - dent on therapy given after failure to reach, or relapse from, remission; this quality means EFS provides a more direct assessment of therapy- based benefit during treatment induction [25]. Time to treatment failure In the context of oncology clinical trials, time- to-treatment failure (TTF) is the time from the initiation of chemotherapy treatment/interven - tion to its early discontinuation. Reasons for prematurely discontinuing treatment can in- clude cancer progression but also adverse events, patient choice, or death. Unlike other clinical endpoints, TTF is regularly used for reg- Oncology clinical endpoints 1124 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 ulatory drug approval since it does not directly measure treatment efficacy [27, 28]. When TTF is used as a primary endpoint, secondary end - points are strategically chosen to explore the portion of patients that discontinued chemo - therapy due to disease progression compared to other reasons [29]. It is also important to consider the age of patients enrolled in the trial when using TTF as a clinical endpoint. Older patients experience higher rates of adverse events during clinical trials; this difference could impact TTF due to adverse events and should be considered during study design [29]. TTF can be an effective endpoint when used alongside OS to provide context to survival, the “gold standard” of treatment assessment. Time to next treatment Time to next treatment (TTNT) is defined as the time from initiating treatment to initiating the next line of therapy [30]. In low grade, incur- able diseases, TTNT is a meaningful endpoint for patients who will require many therapeutic interventions to extend survival. Unlike most disease-related endpoints, TTNT includes the time course of treatment tolerability and pa- tient compliance [30]. TTNT continues to emer- ge as a measure of duration of treatment effi - cacy, specifically in primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas [31]. Despite its usefulness, TTNT is a surrogate marker for duration of clinical benefit and requires validation before serving as a standalone marker to assess treatment efficacy.

Despite its usefulness, TTNT is a surrogate marker for duration of clinical benefit and requires validation before serving as a standalone marker to assess treatment efficacy. Duration of clinical benefit Duration of clinical benefit (DoCB) is defined as the time from randomization to disease pro - gression or death in patients who achieve com- plete response, partial response, or stable dis - ease for 24 weeks or longer [32]. It is a primary endpoint that is used in clinical trials in which disease stabilization in order to prolong surviv - al is the primary goal. Duration of response Duration of response (DoR) is defined as the time from randomization to disease progres - sion or death in patients who achieve complete or partial response [32]. It is closely related to DFS and measures how long a patient will respond to treatment without tumor growth or metastasis. DoR is useful in assessing treat - ments that promise durable response and de- lay disease progression as opposed to treat - ments that provide a temporary remission with- out lasting benefit [32]. Objective response rate Objective response rate (ORR) is a measure of how a specific treatment impacts tumor burden in a patient with a history of solid tumors [33]. It is defined as the proportion of patients that respond either partially or fully to therapy [34]. ORR is a good measure of anti-tumor activity, and there are many different evaluation criteria that have been used to assess ORR in the past [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) was the first to develop criteria to evaluate ORR in clinical trials of cancer treatments. ORR was primarily assessed by tumor size and total tumor load as found via different anatomic imaging modalities [35]. Despite its favora- bility for nearly two decades, the WHO criteria fell out of favor for its interobserver variability of the number of lesions and the selection of measurable targets [36]. It was replaced by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) which has also undergone modifica - tion since its initial design. In its most recent version, RECIST selects target lesions by size and defines them as representative lesions of all involved organs. A maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 in total are considered base - line target lesions while all other lesions are non-target [33]. RECIST can also be used to assess for PFS and defines a progression of disease as a 20% increase in the sum of up to 5 target lesion diameters in reference to the smallest sum acquired [34]. Using RECIST makes ORR a standard clinical endpoint across multiple clinical trial locations, however, there are still some concerns when it comes to ORR’s usefulness as a clinical endpoint. Primarily, ORR fails to capture patients with a stable dis - ease, and it does not differentiate patients wi- th complete response from those with partial response [9]. While transitioning from the WHO criteria to RECIST helped eliminate some of the interobserver variability, it does not completely eliminate the human error that is frequently introduced when measuring tumors via CT or MRI modalities [34]. Moreover, there remain the fundamental concerns that ORR does ade - quately reflect endpoints such as PFS, DFS, and OS despite tumor regression [4]. For now, Oncology clinical endpoints 1125 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 ORR provides the most utility in trials evaluat - ing neoadjuvant therapies, especially those in breast cancer patients [4]. Complete response Complete response (CR) is defined as the lack of detectable evidence of tumor [37]. Imaging studies and histopathology are used to mea - sure CR which can be used as a surrogate or primary endpoint depending on the specific disease or context of use [37]. For example: CR in the setting of multiple myeloma therapy has proven to be clinically relevant as it conveys a survival advantage associated with improved OS and prolonged EFS in specific treatment studies [38, 39]. Pathological complete response Pathologic complete response (pCR) has most oftenbeen used as a surrogate marker in breast cancer and is defined as the absence of resi- dual invasive cancer upon evaluation of the resected breast tissue and regional lymph no- des [40]. This clinical endpoint is commonly used in trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer patients under FDA’s accelerat - ed approval program [41]. In studies following patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, patients who achieved pCR we- re associated with improved OS and EFS [42, 43]. Disease control rate Disease control rate (DCR) describes the per - centage of patients with advanced cancer whose therapeutic intervention has led to a complete response, partial response, or stable disease [44].

DCR is related to ORR and has the greatest utility in evaluating cancer thera - pies that have predominating tumoristatic ef- fects rather than tumoricidal effects [34]. For example, DCR has been found to predict subse- quent survival in extensive stage small cell lung cancer in phase II clinical trials [45]. However, the use of DCR in phase II clinical trials offers little insight to the clinical benefit patients may receive from this therapy. Moreover, some ar- gue that DCR might provide ambiguous infor - mation and potentially exaggerate the antican - cer-effect of the therapy [44]. Clinical benefit rate Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the percentage of advanced cancer patients who achieve complete response, partial response, or at least six months of stable disease as a result of therapy [44]. It has been argued that CBR should not be used at all since it does not measure clinical benefit [44]. There is also sup- port to its use since like DCR, CBR can be use - ful for the rapid assessment of anticancer activity and can further capture disease stabili- zation [44]. Health-related quality of life Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an im- portant measure that is patient reported and demonstrates clinical benefit. It is an evalua - tion of a patient’s quality of life with respect to health status over time [46]. The goal of in- cluding HRQoL as a clinical endpoint is to com- plete the results quantitative endpoints such as OS. Quality of life is often used as a secon- dary clinical endpoint to compare treatments that have similar effects with differences in tox- icity, but it can also be used as a co-primary endpoint with OS [4, 47]. HRQoL is usually assessed using a set of four core questions developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The four core questi- ons include concepts related to overall health, physical health, mental health, and activities of daily living [48]. The items from this survey are brief and provide results that are easy for the assessor to interpret [48]. Milestone survival Milestone survival is defined as the survival probability at a given time point [9]. It is classi - fied as an endpoint related to OS, however, it is considered a qualitative endpoint that de- scribes a cross-sectional assessment at a spe - cific time point and does not account for all OS data [49]. Milestone survival remains a possi - ble surrogate endpoint for OS in late-stage drug development and, similar to the other end - points used to evaluate cancer immunology advancements, requires further validation [49].

Oncology clinical endpoints 1127 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 Discussion The development of targeted therapies has been followed by a shift in the usage of primary clinical endpoints utilized in the evaluation of cancer drugs. The FDA initially used ORR to approve cancer drugs in the 1970s, relying on imaging studies and physical assessments to measure outcomes [27]. It wasn’t until the 1980’s when the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) and FDA recognized that improvements in survival, quality of life, physi - cal functioning, and tumor related symptoms didn’t always correlate with ORR [50]. OS pr- oved to be a superior clinical endpoint for mea- suring direct clinical benefit in oncologic trials. Despite this finding, ORR remains a common surrogate clinical endpoint for cancer drugs under consideration for accelerated approval [50]. Special consideration for ORR as a prima- ry clinical endpoint is also given in single-arm trials of patients with refractory tumors and no current therapy options [51]. Between 1990 and 1999, 30% of trials with FDA-approved cancer drugs used survival as their primary clinical endpoint [8]. This number decreased to 14.5% of clinical trials between 2006 and 2011 [8]. As the number of clinical trials utilizing OS as a primary endpoint decreased, endpoints such as PFS and DFS became more frequently used. Financial and time constraints continue to facilitate this shift since OS requires longer trials with larger numbers of patients compared to surrogate endpoints including PFS and DFS for metastatic and curative cancers, respec - tively. From 2005 to 2013, DFS was used as a primary end point in five of the eight United States approved adjuvant or curative drugs in solid tumors [20]. DFS’s use as a primary clini - cal endpoint in the setting of adjuvant thera - pies is supported by the fact that a large por - tion of patients will have cancer symptoms at the onset of disease recurrence [52]. The FDA now recognizes the clinical benefit of both DFS and PFS and allows for their use as primary end-points in trials seeking regulatory approval [24]. Moreover, there is growing evidence for using PFS and DFS as primary clinical end - points in special circumstances as outlined above. In a recent announcement by the FDA (regulation 21CFR813, subpart H), PFS and other surrogate endpoints can be used in cases to accelerate approval of drugs targeting seri - ous or life-threatening diseases [53]. While prolonging survival is of primary goal of cancer treatments, the value of additional clini- cal endpoints to support OS is becoming clear. Adding more fulfilling time to a patient’s life should be the long-term goal of cancer therapy, and measures including TTP, DCR, CBR and HRQoL can tell physicians more about what Figure 1. Illustration of various endpoints with relationship to hypothetical tumor size on a time scale. Oncology clinical endpoints 1128 Am J Cancer Res 2021;11(4):1121-1131 those extra years of life might look like for a patient. Part of chronic disease management includes mental health support, and clinical tri- als that can tell patients what to expect with regards to their disease state are of particular relevance. Additionally, with increasing interest in immuno-oncology, new endpoints will need to be explored starting from early-phase trials with MTD and MinED. These, paired with mile - stone survival in late-phase trials, will allow researchers to evaluate the nonlinear dose- response and dose-toxicity kinetics character - istic of novel immunotherapy treatments [9]. Since immunotherapy is still a relatively new concept, validation of these unique endpoints will be critical to assessing future studies. Endpoints will continue to evolve not only with the development of new therapies but also as current imaging and detection modalities are defined. This shift has already been demon - strated with the development of RECIST criteria to replace WHO criteria. As clinicians become better at identifying and classifying tumors, it is possible that patients who might have once been labeled with a stable disease would be found to have micrometastasis"}

This shift has already been demon - strated with the development of RECIST criteria to replace WHO criteria. As clinicians become better at identifying and classifying tumors, it is possible that patients who might have once been labeled with a stable disease would be found to have micrometastasis in the future. While current endpoints might capture future changes in imaging, some might start to fall out of favor while others increase in use to safely accelerate drug approval. As more endpoints continue to be developed for specific types of cancer and specific therapies, it is important that studies clearly define which endpoints they are using and be able to differentiate them from other endpoints. For example, differentiat- ing EFS and PFS is heavily dependent on docu- menting death as a distinct event from other adverse outcomes. Moreover, it is important for those involved with study design to be fa- miliar with differences in terminology. While the differences between related endpoints (CBR and DCR; EFS and DFS; CR and pCR) might seem subtle, they are critical to understanding what is being assessed in the study and are each specific to a treatment or cancer type. Conclusions In review, OS remains the “gold standard” pri - mary clinical endpoint. It is easy to measure and since it is not a surrogate endpoint, it can be validated and is widely accepted in the med- ical community. However, it is important to con- tinue to explore the value other endpoints add to assessing adjuvant and neoadjuvant thera - pies. Surrogate endpoints have the potential to lower costs and reduce the number of resourc- es needed to complete clinical trials. Moreover, it has become clear that the use of clinical end- points in oncology will continue to evolve as treatment modalities do, too. Clinical endpoints will be designed with novel immunotherapies in mind and as survival increases, qualitative end- points will become critical secondary endpoints to assess clinical benefit.

This presents a challenge for the oncology clinician given the robust pace of scientific discovery and the increasing num - ber of new drug approvals and expanded indications for previously ap- proved drugs. All currently available antineoplastic therapies have been developed through the clinical trials process. Advanced practitioners (APs) in oncology are often involved in the conduct of clinical trials as primary investigators, sub-investigators, study coordinators, or in the delivery and monitoring of care to patients enrolled in these trials. A prerequisite to evidenced-based practice is understanding how clini - cal trials are conducted and how to critically analyze published results of studies leading to U.S. Food & Drug Administration approval. Any AP involved in the clinical management and supportive care of patients receiving antineoplastic therapies should be able to critically review published data to glean findings that warrant a change in practice. The goals of this manuscript are to summarize key elements of the clinical trial process for oncology drug development and approval in the United States and to provide a primer for the interpretation of clinical data. T ranslating research into clinical practice is a chal - lenging and valuable skill for the advanced prac - titioner (AP) in oncology. Recent analysis of 585 trials registered in the National Cancer Institute Clinical Trials database showed that 29% re - mained unpublished within 5 years of completion of the study (Jones et al., 2013). A second study showed that among 1,075 abstracts describ - ing 378 randomized and 697 nonran- domized clinical trials presented as abstracts at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, only 75% of randomized and 54% of nonrandomized trials (61% overall) were ever published (Massey, Wang, Prasad, Bates, & Fojo, 2016). The av - erage time from completion of a trial and publication among 809 trials closed to accrual between 2009 and 2013 was 47 months, with only 18.8% J Adv Pract Oncol 2020;11(7):736–751 This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Non-Derivative License, which permits unrestricted non-commercial and non-derivative use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. 737 AdvancedPractitioner.com Vol 11  No 7  Sep/Oct 2020 TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO PRACTICECLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN of these being published within 2 years of trial completion (Chapman et al., 2017). Unpublished results limit our ability to integrate the findings of these trials into practice, favorable or unfavorable, and diminish the efforts made by patients partici - pating in those trials. Only 2% to 4% of all adults with cancer participate in clinical trials, the major- ity being under the age of 65 (Denson & Mahipal, 2014). Given the small number of patients partici- pating in clinical trials today, publication of results should be a priority. Furthermore, the robust pace of scientific discovery in oncology places renewed emphasis on the ability of clinicians and scientists to critically review published data to allow appro- priate and effective integration of the findings into the mainstream delivery of care. Advanced practitioners in oncology are in - volved in the clinical management and supportive care of patients receiving antineoplastic therapies. Advanced practitioners are often involved in the conduct of clinical trials as primary investigators (PIs), sub-investigators, study coordinators, or in the delivery and monitoring of care to patients. Although the work is arduous, requiring meticu - lous assessment, documentation, and adherence to the protocol design, bringing a new therapy to trial and in some cases to market is one of the greatest privileges in oncology practice. Under - standing evidence-based practice requires the sys- tematic analysis of the scientific process evident in published works. The ability to independently, critically, and effectively articulate published data allows the AP the ability to glean findings that war- rant a change in practice. Fortunately, summaries provided by various professional organizations, educational groups, or pharmaceutical compa - nies allow for rapid dissemination of clinical trial results. However, the ability to independently re - view and effectively articulate trial results to col - leagues and patients is an invaluable skill for APs. Concepts from the peer review and journal club processes offer practical and well-established cri- teria for critical appraisal of scientific literature. The goals of this manuscript are to summa - rize key elements of the clinical trial process for new oncology drug development and approval in the United States and to provide a primer for the interpretation of clinical data.

KEY ELEMENTS OF CLINICAL TRIALS CONSIDERED IN DRUG APPROVAL Clinical trials are used to test drugs, vaccines, and other medical interventions. Each clinical trial starts with a question or hypothesis gener - ated based on clinical expertise, collaboration, and review of extant literature. It is incumbent on the PI(s) to select a question that will expand knowledge, offer clinical benefit to study partici - pants (efficacy) and improve or sustain quality of life (safety). The trial design will be dictated by the question at hand and the available relevant science. The phase of clinical trial is indicative of the question at hand and the state of science rela - tive to that question (Table 1). The phase of trial indicates the maturity of the science relative to the stated hypothesis and most often guides the study design (Table 2). Interventional trials provide the foundation for new drug approvals in the United States. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) provides the most precise, thorough, and reliable character - ization of therapeutic interventions by limiting bias through randomization (Simon et al., 2015). Blinded RCTs reduce bias further as clinicians are not told whether the patient will receive drug A or drug B. If there is a significant benefit in one arm of the trial at a predefined interim data analysis, crossover to the arm using the newer treatment may be allowed, and the trial will be unblinded at that time. Trials that include a crossover design with unblinding where clinicians may be more inclined to take patients off the control arm may confound analysis of progression-free survival (PFS; Simon et al., 2015). This is in part due to the challenges of recruitment but may also be driven by the selected endpoints and the time required to enroll enough subjects to reach statistical sig - nificance. Overall survival (OS) is generally the gold standard for the primary endpoint in RCTs, although reaching statistically significant OS can take many years in selected diseases. Demonstrat- ing a survival advantage is logistically difficult in diseases with relatively favorable overall survival 738 J Adv Pract Oncol AdvancedPractitioner.com TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO PRACTICE KURTIN and TAHER (patients lost to follow-up) and is very costly. As a result, PFS has been increasingly used as a sur - rogate to OS to allow earlier drug approval with many trials continuing their analysis post approv- al to achieve OS data. It is important to under - stand the differences and implications of different primary and secondary endpoints with regard to drug approval. Although the RCT is considered the gold stan- dard, there are instances in which this study de - sign is not feasible. These include trials for drugs that target rare cancers where there are lim - ited available therapies, trials in which there is a known actionable biomarker, and trials where the currently available therapies are highly toxic and/ or marginally effective (Simon et al., 2015). Single-arm trials, although limited by inher - ent bias, are often used in these cases. Single-arm trials generally focus on overall response rates based on the understanding that without treat - ment, the underlying disease would inevitably progress. Effective single-arm trials often move on to a randomized trial for validation. All RCTs and single-arm interventional trials are built on the foundation of early phase trials necessary for drug development. The rapid expansion of tai - lored therapies, with proof of therapeutic con - cept verified in laboratory models using cell lines derived from the science of cloning, has led to an increase in first-in-human trials approved by the FDA (Prowell, Theoret, & Pazdur, 2016). Rapid expansion of dosing cohorts to establish maxi - mum tolerated dose and efficacy endpoints more efficiently are strategies used to accelerate the drug development process in these trials (May - awala, Tse, Rubin, Jain, & de Alwis, 2017). Most recently, noninferiority trials have emerged to substantiate alternative routes of ad - ministration, schedules for administration, and biosimilar agents. The standards for noninferior - ity trials are different than those for RCTs such that the design and analysis of outcomes must be evaluated within the context of each trial (Dunn, Copas, & Brocklehurst, 2018; Ganju & Rom, 2017). It is not within the scope of this paper to address the scientific principles and processes used in the development and approval of biosimilar agents.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria must be de - fined based on established literature and clini - cal practice guidelines to ensure a homogenous study group and exclude patients who are at in - creased risk for adverse events based on what is known about the drug regimen and the disease be- ing investigated. It is important to note that these patients, in most cases, are not representative of the general population where the presence of co - morbidities or other factors excluded in the trial are prevalent. More recently, therapies tailored to specific targets or pathways have limited inclu - sion criteria such that recruitment may take a pro- longed period of time. It is critical for clinicians to consider the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the postmarketing setting to safely integrate new therapies into practice with patients who may be at a higher risk for adverse events. Safety must be evaluated in every study prior to FDA approval. The Common Terminology Cri - teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) are applied across studies to summarize tolerability, safety, and patient-reported outcomes systematically (Shep - shelovich et al., 2019; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2017). The CTCAE criteria are subdivided by organ system and common ad - verse events. Each adverse event (AE) is graded on a scale of 1 (minor) to 5 (death). This process is critical in interpreting the risks and benefits of each treatment and is used to develop the AE pro- files printed in package inserts for drugs approved by the FDA. The CTCAE has published multiple versions, and it is important to note the version being used in the trial to effectively interpret the AEs reported. To reduce the subjectivity inherent in clinicians’ attribution of AEs, patient-reported outcomes (PRO) have gained importance to better describe safety and tolerability across the life of a trial (Kluetz, Chingos, Basch, & Mitchell, 2016). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the CTCAE (PRO-CTCAE) incorporates 78 patient- reported symptomatic AEs to collect subjective symptoms directly from patients, including mea - sures for health-related quality of life (HRQOL). CLINICAL TRIAL ENDPOINTS Researchers must select primary and secondary endpoints for each study. The primary endpoint is the major focus of the study and is essentially what is expected to happen or the primary aim of the study. Secondary endpoints are outcomes expected to add to the significance of the new therapy being investigated. These endpoints are selected based on analysis of the existing litera - ture, treatment landscape, the anticipated fit of the treatment being studied, power analysis, and the research interests and expertise of the re - search team.

Patient-centered endpoints include OS and HRQOL, both affecting a patient’s feeling of well-being and directing patient clinical benefit. Tumor or disease-specific endpoints include PFS or depth of response. Although OS is considered the hallmark of success, data to support statisti - cally significant improvement of OS may require years of data collection/monitoring based on the expected survival in selected tumor types; PFS always precedes OS and has become a more com - mon primary endpoint in clinical trials today. If PFS or TTP is selected as a primary endpoint, OS should be reported as a secondary endpoint and vice versa. Importantly, OS reporting may be confounded by subsequent therapies (Estey, Othus, Lee, Appelbaum, & Gale, 2016). In the era of accelerated approvals, overall response rate is the standard for a primary endpoint (Blumenthal et al., 2015; Chen, Raghunathan, & Prasad, 2019). Criteria for response should be based on vari - ous disease-specific working group consensus statements. These must be articulated prior to study approval. These criteria provide the founda- tion for claims of efficacy. The specific response criteria and version must be noted, as these crite - ria are regularly updated based on emerging data. The ability to generalize results will be limited by the study design. Comparing two published trials with similar but not exactly the same methods and sample is not recommended. The shift toward precision medicine, immu - notherapies, and other treatments with novel mechanisms of action has shifted the traditional definition of progression and response. The phe - nomenon of pseudoprogression seen in trials us - ing immunotherapies has required redefinition of progression (Hochmair, Schwab, Burghuber, Krenbek, & Prosch, 2017). For patients with rare or extensive disease, stable disease or even a slow progression is considered acceptable outside of a clinical trial (Kaufmann, Pariser, & Austin, 2018). Similarly, the integration of depth of response, specifically achieving undetectable minimal re - sidual disease status in hematologic malignancies has been correlated with PFS and OS and is now being integrated into the response criteria for se - lected diseases (Gormley et al., 2016; Hallek et al., 2018; Heuser, Mina, Stein, & Altman, 2019; Kovacs et al., 2016; Medeiros, 2018; Molica, Giannarelli, & Montserrat, 2019). Although these new criteria have been defined, the application in general prac- tice for patients treated outside of a clinical trial is not clearly defined in many cases. Caution is recommended prior to changing therapies where there is no clear data to support loss of undetect - able minimal residual disease as progression. The duration of response, although not often a primary endpoint, is critical to evaluating treat - ment options over time. The durability of a treat - ment option including tolerability is often lost in a new drug approval where the data cutoff points are focused on achievement of the primary and secondary endpoints to support approval. Both long-term responses, survival, and late relapses are not captured in trials that do not monitor pa - tients over time or where patients are lost to fol - low-up (Cuzick, 2015). In addition, many blinded trials are unblinded at predetermined data cut - off points to facilitate statistical analysis, making long-term analysis of outcomes more difficult. Case reports and anecdotal data are often the mainstay for reporting outcomes in the subset of patents that achieve the most durable responses to investigational agents that are subsequently ap- proved (Kurtin & List, 2009). CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS A site initiation visit is conducted by the study monitor to ensure that all clinicians and clini - cal trials staff are registered on the study, fully trained on all aspects of the study, and understand the processes for conducting the study, including reporting of unexpected adverse events or devia - tions. Consent forms, data monitoring processes and forms, and safety requirements are outlined in detail. Once the study is open at an individual site, patient accrual begins.

If a patient is eligible for a trial, it is always a preferred option, as accessibility and eli - gibility for trials can change quickly. Applying the mantra “Never exclude a treatment option” will offer the patient the best opportunity to receive all available therapies. For those patients interested in participating in a clinical trial, a detailed process of screening ensures application of the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. If eligible, the clinical trial is then submitted for insurance approval for the individual patient. Unfortunately, despite federal legislation, not all insurance plans approve inves - tigational treatment. The number of open trials in the United States and the number of FDA approv- als in oncology over the past decade contribute to challenges in the recruitment of patients. In many instances, patients are not referred to tertiary centers for clinical trial participation if FDA-ap - proved drugs are available for use. Each trial includes a schema, or a calendar of events with a detailed step-by-step process for conducting the trial. The schema includes any diagnostic imaging, laboratory or tissue testing, clinical visits, and medication reconciliation. Also included in most studies are patient journals to fa- cilitate self-reporting of any adverse events.

Patients are queried for HRQOL indices at prespecified intervals to evaluate patient-reported outcomes. Reviewing the schema and the intensi - ty of visits is critical to guide the patient in making the decision to participate. For some patients, the intensity of a trial, particularly phase I trials that require frequent pharmacokinetic testing, may dissuade the patient from participation. Safety monitoring is at the core of managing patients on clinical trials and requires attention to detail. Advanced practitioners are often desig - nated as Co-PIs or sub-investigators on these tri - als and see patients for trial-related visits. These visits require a detailed review of systems to cap - ture any changes from baseline, details of any new clinical or symptom findings, and capture of any missed doses or medications added for symptom management. Adverse events must be attributed as to system, causality, and estimated severity (Ta- bles 4 and 5). These attributions are the primary source for reporting safety and are used to create the tables and charts included in package inserts for FDA-approved drugs. Patients who require ur- gent or emergent care or hospitalization require immediate reporting and are automatically con - sidered to have serious adverse events that must be reported to the medical monitor for the study within 24 to 48 hours. This requires a coordinated effort on the part of the research team, the patient, and their caregivers. Accurate and timely report - ing is essential to avoid adverse events related to the investigational regimen across all study sites. Despite ongoing efforts to refine the definitions to limit variability in attributions, the system re - mains imperfect and open to subjective interpre - tation (George et al., 2019). Postmarketing report- ing is critical to integrate continued observations for approved drugs, flag any sentinel events, and continue to ensure the safety of the public at large. THE FDA APPROVAL PROCESS Prior to 1992, FDA approval was only granted through the standard process for review and in the majority of cases required completion of a RCT. The FDA established the Oncology Center of Ex - cellence (OCE) in January 2017 to streamline the development of cancer therapies through expedit- ed review of drugs, biologics, and devices (Gold - berg, Blumenthal, McKee, & Pazdur, 2018). The accelerated approval pathway utilizes surrogate measures such as biomarkers, objective overall re- sponse, and in some cases, clinical benefit (Chen et al., 2019; Gyawali, Hey, & Kesselheim, 2019). This is in response to the transformative effect of biomarker-driven therapies, the field of immunol- ogy, and the desire to make these drugs available to the public. Between December 11, 1992, and May 31, 2017 , the FDA granted accelerated approval for drugs considered to be transformative in areas of high unmet need based on phase II data and on end - points other than OS (Beaver et al., 2018; Bloom - field et al., 2018). Among 64 malignant hematol - ogy and oncology products for 93 new indications, the most common primary endpoints included re- sponse rate (n = 81, 87%), PFS or TTP (n = 8, 9%), and disease-free survival (n = 4, 4%). Importantly, 744 J Adv Pract Oncol AdvancedPractitioner.com TRANSLATING RESEARCH INTO PRACTICE KURTIN and TAHER single-arm trial designs were the most common (n = 67 , 72%; Beaver et al., 2018). For many trials with accelerated approval, postmarketing valida - tion via long-term follow-up or conduct of a phase III randomized trial may be required for contin - ued approval. In this analysis, at a median of 3.4 years after the accelerated approval, 55% (n = 51) had fulfilled their postmarketing requirement and verified benefit, 40% (n = 37) had not yet complet- ed the confirmatory trials, and 5% (n = 5) had been withdrawn from the market.

The CTCAE reporting structure (Table 4) in clinical trials has required continued editing to reflect knowledge gained across medical special - ties relevant to organ function, degree of organ damage, and the potential causative agent. Publi - cation of pivotal trials provides the most complete publicly available resource for summarizing ad - verse events. Reading the package insert and the published registration trial is recommended to integrate new therapies into practice and to guide estimates of risk and benefits. Understanding the grading system for AEs, the criteria for specific toxicities, and the population studied in the piv - otal trial will improve APs’ ability to safely inte - grate new therapies into practice. Importantly, package inserts include all trials registered for the approved agent and must be interpreted in the context of the specific diseases and any combina - tion regimens. Adverse events are generally summarized in publications and in the package insert as all- grade or grade ≥ 3.

Unfortunately, many treatments are prematurely discontinued without application of all available strategies available for mitigation and manage - ment, effectively limiting potential benefit due to the fear of AEs. Given the inherent flaws of clinician-only reporting of AEs using the CTCAE criteria, the PRO-CTCAE has been developed (Kluetz et al., 2016). Familiarity with the PRO-CTCAE will be - come a necessary component of conducting clini - cal trials in oncology to optimize benefit and limit risk. Adverse events attributed to immunothera - pies have required development of specific crite - ria to estimate severity (Michot et al., 2016; Wang & Xu, 2019; Yu et al., 2019). IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AP All currently available therapies for cancer patients have been derived through the conduct of clinical trials. Advanced practitioners in oncology play an integral role in the conduct of clinical trials and in the integration of new therapies into mainstream practice. Review and synthesis of the plethora of clinical trial outcome data has become an arduous yet essential task. Applying general concepts and strategies for review will assist in the interpretation and clinical application of the emerging data. Fa - miliarity with the hierarchy of clinical trial design, the shifting of desired endpoints in the era of pre- cision medicine and robust clinical development, and the necessity of incorporating patient-reported outcomes will be necessary for all oncology clini - Figure 1. Example Kaplan-Meier curves of overall survival (OS) from an original data set (red) plus a follow-up analysis set (blue). As more patients completed the protocol and had additional follow-up, the median survival and 5-year OS increased. The dotted lines and open circles indicate the median survival for the original data set (red) and follow-up analysis set (blue), respectively. The 5-year survival estimates (solid black line) for the original data set and follow-up analysis set are represented by the red- and blue-filled circles, respectively. Note that the median (dotted black line) intersects with the “plateau” of events for the blue cohort and is therefore less informative than the median for the red cohort. Censored patients are indicated with vertical lines on the curves. The black dotted line is the median, colored dotted lines and open circles are where the KM curve and median intersect, and filled circles represent the 5-year OS estimate.

For those APs involved in the conduct of clinical trials, familiarity with new definitions of response, changes in the attestation of AEs, including patient-reported outcomes, will be imperative to the effective conduct and report- ing of the trial.

A waterfall plot displays patients, ordered by their best response in tumor shrinkage, with y-axis as percent change from baseline of target lesions (Gillespie, 2012). Wa- terfall plots typically sort the x-axis by the same value displayed on the y-axis like a cascade of water. In this illustration, subjects are sorted in descending order so patients on the right (with large negative val- ues in percent change from baseline) represent those responding well to treatment (tumor shrinkage), while those on the left typically represent those with potential disease progression. Each bar represents a single patient. These may be colored according to add further detail to the waterfall plot. Adapted from Miclaus, K., & Li, L. (2018).

In spite of time-consuming processes and high costs, the overall success rate of clinical trials is only 7.9%, which is a high risk for biopharmaceutical companies. However, despite these huge risks, research on finding factors affecting clinical trials to overcome and manage to risks has been insufficient. Considering these characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry, this study investigated the factors affecting the success of sponsor-initiated clinical trials. The success factors investigated were categorized into four factors: quality of clinical trials, speed of clinical trials, relationship type, and communication. Logistic regression was performed to measure each factor by analyzing 24,295 cases of Phase 1 to 4 trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Because of the analysis, the factors affecting the success of the clinical trials were varied according to each clinical phase and the drug types: New Molecular Entity (NME)/ Biologics, and the success ratio in the quality variable affected the overall clinical trial phases. Additionally, the experience, speed, relationship type, and communication variables were also found to be statistically significant for the success of each phase and drug type. Keywords Clinical trials · Success factor · New drug development · New Molecular Entity · Biological drugs Introduction The R&D process of new drug development is a time- consuming and expensive process. The new drug develop- ment process consists of a series of steps to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates, and the most time-consuming and costly stage is the clinical trial stage. It takes more than 10 years to develop the technology for an overall biopharmaceutical [1 ] and the cost of a successful clinical trial is about $2.6 billion [2 ]. For most time-con- suming process of R&D is clinical trials. Although there are differences among studies related to the development period of a new drug, an average of 7.6 years was found for a Phase 1 clinical trial by a Korean pharmaceutical company [3] and 6.8 years for a foreign pharmaceutical company [2].Eungdo Kim and Jaehoon Yang are co-first authors and contributed equally. * Kwangsoo Shin ksshin@catholic.ac.kr Eungdo Kim edkim@chungbuk.ac.kr Jaehoon Yang lksdfoi@snu.ac.kr Sungjin Park inforary@gmail.com 1 Department of R&D Planning and Support, Biomedical Research Institute, Chungbuk National University Hospital, 776 1Sunhwan-ro, Seowon-Gu, Cheong-Ju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of Korea 2 Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Seoul National University, 145 Gwanggyo-Ro, Yeongtong-Gu, Suwon 16229, South Korea 3 Graduate School of Biomedical Convergence, College of Medicine, Chungbuk National University, 1 Chungdae-ro, Seowon-gu, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of Korea 4 Graduate School of Public Health and Healthcare Management, The Catholic University of Korea, Banpo-Daero 222, Seocho-Gu, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea 5 Catholic Institute for Public Health and Healthcare Management, The Catholic University of Korea, Banpo-Daero 222, Seocho-Gu, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea 6 Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, Chungbuk National University, 1 Chungdae-ro, Seowon-gu, Cheongju, Chungbuk 28644, Republic of Korea Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 Clinical trials are long-term projects and, at the same time, are expensive. In a 2015 study on the cost of new drug development, DiMasi found that the total cost of clinical trials conducted from 2000 to mid-2010 was $14.6 billion, exceeding the total cost of clinical trials from 1970 to 2000 ($8.2 billion) [2]. However, despite the investment of large amounts of time and money, the success rate of new drug development from conception to new drug registration is 7.9%, which shows low investment efficiency [4]. Although new drug development requires a large amount of investment in terms of time and cost, the reason pharmaceutical com- panies strive to develop new drugs is that the rewards they receive from successful new drug development are large. When a new drug is developed successfully, pharmaceuti- cal companies can not only recover their investment costs for new drug development but also create huge added value and secure a long-term monopoly and professional market position [5]. As we have seen so far, the clinical trial process in new drug development is an essential process to prove the effi- cacy and safety of a drug, and it is also a challenge that phar- maceutical companies must solve for new drug development. Analyzing these challenges effectively and finding strate- gic solutions can be a way to raise therapeutic innovation through inspiring R&D productivity in the pharmaceutical industry and to successfully develop new drugs. Therefore, this study aimed to conduct research that can help the suc- cess of clinical trials by reviewing studies related to the suc- cess of clinical trials. The previous studies are survey studies conducted by experts in the pharmaceutical industry, the studies using small-scale data related to specific diseases, factor analysis studies through literature reviews, and studies on the success of clinical trials as the next stage of entry or regulatory approval. These studies were qualitative studies that did not use actual clinical data, or used only small-scale data focusing on specific diseases even if data were used.

Furthermore, the factors were analyzed by drug type and clinical stage using the actual clinical trial data provided by ClinicalTrials.gov which is a database operated by the US. National Library of Medicine and the US. National Institute of Health. This database includes clinical trial information related to disease and condition for researchers, patients, and various stakeholders related with healthcare industry. To briefly introduce this study, in “ Theoretical Back - ground and Modelling” section, through a literature review, the importance of clinical trials, which account for a large part of new drug development, and the theoretical back - ground of the definitions and factors of clinical trials’ success are reviewed. Additionally, a research model and hypothesis are presented, using the definitions and factors for the success of the clinical trial used in this study. “Mate- rials and Methods” section describes the data collection and purification process, the analysis method, and variables for performing this study. In “Results and Discussion”section, the results of the statistical analysis of the success factors of the clinical trials discussed above are presented, and in “Conclusion” section, the significance and l imitations of this study are presented. Theoretical Background and Modeling The Importance of Clinical Trials in the New Drug Development Process When designing a clinical trial, a new drug developer starts the new drug research process by considering the goals to be achieved at each clinical trial stage. The goal of new drug development is to bring a new compound with a proven therapeutic effect to the market, and approval from clinical trials attracts investors and increases the company’s value. However, there is not only an optimistic future for clini- cal trials. Most compounds fail before being brought to the market, which means a cumulative consumption of resources devoted to conducting clinical trials. In particular, the impact of the failure of Phase 3 clinical trials poses a risk to the sur- vival of small biotech companies (and investors), and large companies find themselves in a situation of mergers [6]. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies must plan clinical trials through thorough clinical trial planning and pre-prep- aration before starting clinical trials and establish strategies to increase the likelihood of a clinical trial’s success through multi-faceted analysis according to the drug and clinical trial type. Based on the need for research on the success of clini- cal trials, in this study, the success factors were analyzed by reviewing the literature related to the success of clinical trials, and the success factors revealed through this review were analyzed by empirical data. Research and clinical trial data registered on ClinicalTrials.gov was used to investigate the drug types and success factors in the clinical phase. Definition of Clinical Trial Success With respect to the success of clinical trials, there is a uni- versal perception that patient registration is a key factor in determining the success of clinical trials, and an analysis of clinical trials registered as closed in 2011 showed that 19% of clinical trials were terminated due to insufficient numbers Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 of participants [7 ]. Johnson noted that approximately 80% of clinical trials do not meet the initial enrollment goals and timelines, and these delays result in a loss of $8 million in revenue per day for drug discovery companies [8 ]. In the data investigated in this study, among the clinical trials that were terminated, many cases were found that were termi- nated due to failure in patient registration. Additionally, in the case of Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the number of patients required to prove the safety and efficacy of a drug increase from 100 to 1000, and thus, patient registration in clinical trials could be considered a key success factor. As mentioned above, many studies have revealed the importance of patient registration, but studies conducted by defining successful patient registration as the measure of success in clinical trials have not been investigated. Additionally, the only data collected from ClinicalTrials. gov that can be considered a success factor for clinical tri- als are those on the patient registration status. Therefore, in this study, successful patient registration is defined as clinical trial success, and the success factors of the clinical trial are identified using a new definition that has not been used in previous studies. Table 1 shows the definition"}

Additionally, the only data collected from ClinicalTrials. gov that can be considered a success factor for clinical tri- als are those on the patient registration status. Therefore, in this study, successful patient registration is defined as clinical trial success, and the success factors of the clinical trial are identified using a new definition that has not been used in previous studies. Table 1 shows the definition of clinical trial success in previous studies. Success Factors of Clinical Trials To investigate the success factors of clinical trials, the litera- ture was searched by combining keywords such as “clinical trial”, “success factor”, “success rate”, “clinical trial phase”, “experience”, and “duration”. First, in light of the existing research on the quality of clinical trials, the research was subdivided into studies on the success ratio and experience of clinical trials. In relation to studies related to the success rate of clinical trials, it is essential to prove drug efficacy and safety, which increase the clinical success rate. Additionally, high-level clinical research quality, understanding and compliance with the related regulations (GCP, etc.), research design and plan- ning, etc., were investigated as factors of successful clinical trials [13– 15]. In research related to clinical trial experi- ence, Lo revealed the most important features for predict- ing success through drug approval prediction research using machine learning techniques. These factors are trial outcomes, trial status, trial accrual rates, duration, prior approval for another indication, and the sponsor’s track record. Lo also said that expertise in drug development and candidate substances sponsored by a company that has expe- rienced successful clinical trials in the past increases the likelihood of success in clinical trials [9 ]. Similar to Lo’s research, Thunecke investigated the experience before clini- cal trials in the field as the factor with the highest predictive value for clinical trial success [6]. Second, the duration of a clinical trial relates to the speed of a clinical trial and is directly related to the investment cost, and the shorter the clinical trial period, the lower the clinical trial cost, thereby reducing the financial burden on the company. The speed of clinical trials is important when companies select clinical trial partners for rapid clinical trial progress [14, 15]. In addition, it has been found that rapid patient recruitment for clinical trials affects the speed of clinical trial completion [16]. A study by Big Pharma companies, such as TTC Inc., Merck, and Quintiles, found that trial sites that randomized the first patients tended to perform better overall [ 17]. Taken together, rapid clinical trial execution shortens the clinical trial period, which is an important factor in clinical trial success. Third, in research related to relationship types, Lin con- ducted multinomial regression analysis with data from 4494 organizations and 18,040 clinical trials. The analysis built temporal networks of clinical trial collaborations among large and small pharmaceutical companies, academic insti- tutions, nonprofit organizations, hospital systems, and gov - ernment agencies to determine the relationships of clinical trial success and the collaborative network structure of each actor, organizational behavior, and partnership characteris- tics. Especially in the context of clinical trials not explored in previous studies, cooperation between organizations was characterized and the trends of successful organizations were investigated. As a result, it was found that the diversity of collaboration was associated with better research results and high efficiency, and the analysis found that collaboration networks tended to select other actors with proven success records as the preferred negotiators. Historically, success- ful large pharmaceutical companies benefit when attracting actors with diverse therapeutic expertise and experience, which explains the correlation between success and col- laborative diversity [18]. Forth, in terms of communication, Getz discovered that research sites with sufficient infrastructure for clinical trials are 41% better than sites dedicated to clinical trials in terms Table 1 Definition of clinical trial success Definition Previous studies Clinical trial success A successful clinical trial is one that passes on to the next stage after the regulatory body has approved the use of the drug or the clinical trial has been completed [2, 9] Patient registration is recognized as an important factor for the success of clinical trials [10–12] Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 of patient enrollment based on data provided across 10 thera- peutic areas by 50 pharmaceutical and biotech companies [17]. Jung and Kim et al. investigated the need for close col- laboration and communication between the sponsor and the researcher when conducting clinical trials [13, 14]. Jung also investigated the need for a coordinating center that shares information and controls the entire clinical trial process for multi-institutional collaboration in clinical trials [13]. In addition, Smietana et al. analyzed the probability of the clinical trial success of pharmaceutical companies through an external analysis from 1996 to 2014. He used Informa’s Pharma project database for an industry-wide evaluation to track the clinical and regulatory progress of more than 9200 new compounds. The subjects"}

Jung also investigated the need for a coordinating center that shares information and controls the entire clinical trial process for multi-institutional collaboration in clinical trials [13]. In addition, Smietana et al. analyzed the probability of the clinical trial success of pharmaceutical companies through an external analysis from 1996 to 2014. He used Informa’s Pharma project database for an industry-wide evaluation to track the clinical and regulatory progress of more than 9200 new compounds. The subjects of this analysis were synthetic and biological drugs, and natural substances with possible biological origin were excluded. The success rate of each development stage was determined based on the ratio of successful drugs among all compounds that escaped the stage during a given period, and major trends related to clinical trials were analyzed. The recent increase in the success rate of clinical trials was related to the tendency of pharmaceutical companies to focus on pipelines such as orphan drugs, immuno-oncology drugs, and antiviral drugs, which have a relatively high probability of success and to increase the success rate of clinical trials through partnerships [19]. In a study on the importance of clinical trial partners, it was found that the higher the clinical trial success rate, the higher the number of affiliated drugs, large companies, and partners [20]. Additionally, factors such as drug characteristics, patient recruitment, organizational structure, researchers’ interest, and finances were found to affect the clinical trial success by various studies. However, in this study, four success factors, namely quality, speed, relationship type, and communica- tion, were analyzed due to the limitations of data gathering. The quality factor of clinical trials was analyzed in terms of the success rate and experience of clinical trials, and the speed factor of clinical trials was analyzed by the duration of the clinical trial. For the relationship type factor, the diver - sity of collaborators was found to have a positive effect on the results of clinical trials. In this study, the presence or absence of collaborators was investigated to find whether Table 2 Success factors of clinical trials Factors Details Descriptions Related studies Quality Clinical trial experience The strength of the Phase 2 data The sponsor’s previous experience in the field [6] As predictors of clinical trial success, test results, test status, increase in the patient recruitment rate, trial period, sponsor’s prior approval for other drugs, and sponsor’s past success were revealed [9] Clinical trial success ratio Proof of drug efficacy and safety is essential and increases the clinical success rate [21, 22] Understanding and compliance with GCP [3, 13] Speed Clinical trial duration An increase in the patient recruitment speed increases the speed of clinical completion [16] Time taken to conduct clinical trials [15] Investigators who can recruit enough patients [14, 15] Rapid clinical trial progress [14] Relationship Collaboration Research networks (collaboration) in various subject areas influence the success of clinical trials [18] Use of licensed compounds through cross-organizational collaboration [19] The clinical trial success rate is improved by the number of partners, the number of alliance medicines, and company size [20] Communication Regional coherence Close communication and cooperation between the sponsor and the investigator [14] Close cooperation between companies and government departments [13] Other Drug properties Orphan drugs, immunotherapeutic drug development, and use of bio- markers have a high success rate [23] Selection of good drug candidates [24] Patient registration Patient burden (patients’ abandonment of the clinical trial) [25] Lack of eligible patients [26, 27] Organization Sufficient auxiliary personnel needed to conduct research [15] A system that enables researchers to conduct systematic research [13] Finance Importance of financial support in Phase 3 clinical trials [21] Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 they affect the success of clinical trials. Lastly, in the com- munication factor, close cooperation between sponsors and collaborators in clinical trials was found to affect the success of clinical trials. In this study, the regional coherence of the institutions was investigated by dividing the institutions by country and continent. The variables of the previous studies summarized above are arranged in Table 2 into five fac- tors: Quality, Speed, Relationship, Communication and the Others. Hypothesis Development Quality of Clinical Trial and Clinical Trial Success The quality of clinical trials is an important indicator for mov- ing clinical trials to the next stage. Regarding the quality of clinical trials, it was found that the adequacy of clinical trial planning and operation was the main characteristic, and it could be linked to the success of clinical trials [13, 28]. Qual- ity in clinical trials also means the quality of GCP compliance. Therefore, successful clinical trial means that a well-planned clinical trial protocol and compliance with related regulations were thoroughly followed. In this context, experiences and success ratio of the former clinical trials can be treated as fac- tors leading the future successful clinical trials. This study measured the quality of clinical research as a factor influencing a clinical trial’s success by analyzing the clinical trial experi- ence and the clinical"}

Hypothesis Development Quality of Clinical Trial and Clinical Trial Success The quality of clinical trials is an important indicator for mov- ing clinical trials to the next stage. Regarding the quality of clinical trials, it was found that the adequacy of clinical trial planning and operation was the main characteristic, and it could be linked to the success of clinical trials [13, 28]. Qual- ity in clinical trials also means the quality of GCP compliance. Therefore, successful clinical trial means that a well-planned clinical trial protocol and compliance with related regulations were thoroughly followed. In this context, experiences and success ratio of the former clinical trials can be treated as fac- tors leading the future successful clinical trials. This study measured the quality of clinical research as a factor influencing a clinical trial’s success by analyzing the clinical trial experi- ence and the clinical trial success rate based on the sponsor’s past clinical trial data, and established Hypotheses H1 and H2. H1 The sponsor’s clinical trial experience will have a positive impact on the clinical trial’s success. H2 The sponsor’s clinical trial success rate will have a positive impact on the clinical trial’s success. Speed of Clinical Trials and Clinical Trial Success The duration of clinical trials is a key factor in determining the financial risks and rewards of drug development projects [23]. The duration of clinical trials is 2.7 years, 3.2 years, and 3.8 years, respectively, for Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials [2], and the success rate from clinical trial success to new drug approval is less than 7.9% [4 ]. Therefore, as the clinical trial’s dura- tion becomes longer, it creates a financial risk, along with an increase in research expenses from the company’s perspective. In addition, as a result of analyzing the difference between ter- minated and successful clinical trials, it was found that Phase 2 trials of drugs that did not proceed to Phase 3 trials tended to end 8.1 months earlier [23]. As such, the speed of clinical trials is focused on whether clinical investigators can quickly recruit patients and conduct research as well-planned clinical trials [14, 28, 29]. Therefore, in this study, as stated in Hypothesis H3, the number of days from the actual clinical trial data to the success of the clinical trial were measured and analyzed as a success factor. H3 The duration of the clinical trial will have a negative impact on the clinical trial’s success. Relationship Type and Clinical Trial Success Regarding the type of relationship between the sponsor and the collaborator, as in Lin’s study, for examining the association between cohesion and diversity in the cooperative network of clinical trials according to the relationship type, it was suggested that the diversifica- tion of the network affects the success [18]. In addition, Smietana analyzed recent trends in the success rate of clinical trials and found that the success rate of clinical trials with partnerships was high [19]. Recently, as the pharmaceutical industry has shifted to an open innova- tion framework due to the high risk of the development process, the role of the sponsor’s collaborator in clinical trials has become important [30]. In particular, Pam- molli et al. calculated the success rate of a new drug development project based on the number of non-indus- trial partners, not the pharmaceutical industry, and con- firmed that the success rate of clinical trials increased by 11.3 percentage points when non-industrial partners participated [31]. These results highlight the benefits of collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and organizations outside the industry in terms of the success of clinical trials. In light of the research inves- tigated above, in this study, the effect of the sponsor’s collaborator on the success of the clinical trial was ana- lyzed, as described by Hypothesis H4. H4 The presence of a clinical trial collaborator will have a positive effect on the clinical trial’s success. Communication and clinical trial success In many existing studies related to communication, it was found that close communication between the sponsor and the collaborator affects the success of clinical trials [13, 14, 18]. To analyze the impact of communication, formal and informal communication methods and data collection are required during the specific processes of the clinical trial. Reus & Lamont found that when there is a regional distance difference between the two parties to a collaboration, the Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 cultural differences are exacerbated, making communication more difficult [32]. Therefore, within the scope of data col- lection for this study, the influence of communication was analyzed by exploring whether the sponsor and collaborator were from the same region (Hypothesis H5). H5 The regional coherence of sponsors and collaborators will have a positive impact on the clinical trial’s success. Materials and Methods Data To analyze the four factors (quality, speed, relationship type, and communication), data on successful and unsuccessful clinical trials from 2010 to June 2020 and from Phases 1 to 4 were collected from ClinicalTrials.gov. The ClinicalTrials. gov database is the world’s largest clinical trial information database, providing more than 430,000 clinical trial informa- tion in 221 countries. This database which includes differ - ent regional attributes is needed to analyze regional factor effect to the success of clinical trials. And also, the database should provide sponsor and collaborator information by each phase. Therefore, we only focused on the most adequate and enormous open-source database"}

In the data purification process, data that did not specify the geographic location of the sponsors and collaborators were excluded, and all data in which errors were found after data collection in ClinicalTrials.gov were also excluded. Additionally, the search was limited to industry-led research, but all data in which individual researchers were entered in the sponsor column were also excluded. In addition to the clinical trial data, necessary data were collected through Bloomberg, the companies’ websites, and Google and linked with the data matching the sponsor’s name. Details of the data collection and cleaning methods are shown in Table 3. Estimation Procedure In this study, logistic regression was used to analyze the factors affecting the success of clinical trials. The reason for using logistic regression analysis is that the data express- ing the success or failure of the clinical trial were classified as 0 and 1 as the dependent variable. The statistical sig- nificance of the independent variables affecting the success of clinical trials was investigated through the odds ratio, and all statistical analyses were performed with p-values of < 0.01, < 0.05, and < 0.1. The collected data were analyzed using the STATA 16.1 program. log P 1 − P = /u1D6FD0 + /u1D6FD1 X1 .

According to ClinicalTrials.gov, a successful clinical trial is a clinical trial in which patient registration has been com- pleted, and a failed clinical trial is defined as a clinical trial in which patient registration has been completed during or before the completion of the clinical plan. The data were coded as 1 for successful clinical trials and 0 for failed clini- cal trials. Independent Variables In this study, factors affecting clinical trial success were analyzed by dividing them into four factors: quality, speed, relationship, and communication. The quality of clinical tri- als was investigated by the total number of clinical trials across the duration of the investigation and the success rate of previous clinical trials, and the speed of clinical trials was defined as how many days it took for the trials to succeed. Regarding the presence of collaborators in the clinicaltrio- als.gov data, the relationship type was classified as 1 if there was a collaborator and 0 if the company conducted an inde- pendent study. Communication was based on the address of the sponsor and collaborator to reveal whether the nations or continents were the same, scored as 0 if they were not identical and 1 if they were the same. Table 4 shows how to define and measure all independent and dependent variables used in this study. Results and Discussion All descriptive statistics and multicollinearity of the vari- ables used in this study are shown in Table 5. In order to analyze the relative influence of variables that affect the success of a clinical trial, Pearson’s correla- tion analysis was performed to investigate the correlations between variables. As a result, the correlation between nation and continent of sponsors and collaborators showed the most positive relationship (r = 0.861, p < 0.01), and the clinical trial success rate and clinical trial duration had the Table 4 Definition and measurement of variables Variables Factors Variables Definition Measurement Related Studies Dependent Variable Status Status Success of clinical trials If terminated = 0, Otherwise = 1 [10–12] Independent Variables Quality Experience Cumulative number of total clinical trials of sponsor Total number of terminated and completed clinical tri- als of sponsor [6] Success Ratio Cumulative success ratio of clinical trials of sponsors Number of successful clinical trials before the trial / total number of clinical trials before the trial [6, 13, 21, 22] Speed Duration Days taken to complete clini- cal trials Number of days from the beginning to complete of clinical trials [14–16] Relation Type Relation Type Presence of clinical trial partners If absence of partners = 0, existence of partners = 1 [18–20]"}

Table 6 presents the correlations between the variables. Although there is no significant associated multicol- linearity among independent variables using VIF analysis (Table 5), nation and continent variables should be treated carefully for a more appropriate model. As the result of Pearson’s correlation analysis, there are three relatively high correlation pairs in the lower right corner of Table 6. Therefore, we made four regression models with pseudo- R2 close to zero by backward selection method. Model 1 concerns every factor of quality, speed, relation type and communication. Model 2 doesn’t consider the factor of communication. Model 3 and Model 4 discard relation type factor but each model includes different variables of communication factor. Table 7 shows the results of the logistic regression anal- ysis of the effects of clinical trial experience and success rate, clinical trial duration, relation type, and the regional coherence of sponsors and collaborators on overall clini- cal trial success. The p-value of the log-likelihood ratio, excluding the presence of sponsors (relationship type) and the regional coherence of sponsors and collaborators (nation, continent), was also under 0.01. This result shows that the quality and speed variables are related to a clinical trial’s success. According to the odds ratio of each independent variable, the variables with statistically significant results are the experience, success ratio. However, the results were derived that the duration variable also had a positive effect on the success of the clinical trial, so Hypothesis 3 was not supported.

Table 9 presents the logistic regression results for phase 2 clinical trials of NME and biologicals. In phase 2 clinical tri- als, the factors affecting the clinical trial success of synthetic new drugs and biological agents were different. There was also a difference in the degree of influence on clinical trials. In the case of NME, clinical trial experience, success ratio and duration had a strong influence (p < 0.01, respectively) on the success of clinical trials, whereas for biologicals, only experience and success ratio had a statistically significant effect (p < 0.1; p < 0.01). Table 10 shows the logistic regression results for phase 3 clinical trials NME and biologicals. In the phase 3 clini- cal trials, the factors affecting the success of the clinical trials of NME and biologicals were different.

Table 11 shows the logistic regression results of phase 4 clinical trials of NME and biologicals. For biological agents, the alternative hypothesis related with clinical trial success ratio was rejected, as the p-value of the likelihood ratio was greater than 0.1. As a result of measuring the odds ratio of NME, it was found that only the clinical trial success rate was related to clinical trial success (p < 0.01). In summary, the factors affecting clinical trials are revealed differently by interventions and phases. Especially, success ratio is strongly related with clinical trials of every intervention and phase except phase 4 of biologicals. In addition, experience affects the success of phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for both NME and biologicals. These results complement Lo’s study [ 9], which showed that the spon - sor’s prior clinical trial success record is useful factor for predicting a clinical trial’s success. It provides statistical background to support Getz’s study [17] showing that a site that performed well previously has a 70% chance of yielding a better research outcome. On the other hand, relationship type, and nation and continent, which are variables related to communica- tion, were not significant in the overall model (Model 1 in Table 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12), but significant effects were found in the detailed model. Factors related with relation type only affect NME in Model 2 of phase 1, 3 (p < 0.1; p < 0.05). And nation and continent variables, which are proxies of communication, positively and significantly affected the success in Model 3, 4 of phase 3 of the clinical trial (p < 0.05, respectively). Being inferred as represent- ing the characteristics of phase 3 trials. The purpose of a phase 3 clinical trial is to confirm the efficacy of the drug in a large patient group, and research into racial diversity in responses to new drugs is being conducted in many hos - pitals including various ethnic groups in various regions [29]. Reflecting these characteristics of phase 3 trials, the presence of a collaborator (relationship type) and the geographical coherence of the sponsor and collaborator (nation, continent) were statistically significantly related to the success of the phase 3 clinical trials. Further results of this study are summarized in the Table 12. Conclusion In previous studies related to the success of clinical trials, there have been many studies with complete information on several characteristics based on drug types and indica- tions in general, and these have mostly been based on a small number of examples [9 ]. To overcome this limita- tion, factors affecting clinical trial success were analyzed with the data of 24,695 cases of actual successful and unsuccessful clinical trials registered at ClinicalTrials. gov. In this study, the characteristics of successful clini- cal trials are investigated leveraging vast amount of actual clinical trial data relative to previous studies through four categorized factors by drug types. Our study found that the experience and success rate of clinical trials, which are qualitative factors of clinical trials, can have a posi- tive effect on the success of clinical trials in phase 1–4, excluding biologics in phase 3. Furthermore, this study emphasizes that the factors affecting clinical trial success differ by interventions and phases. In particular, this study found out the roles of relationship type and communica- tion in phase 3. With the above findings, this study draws following three practical implications. First, since many products in biophar- maceutical industry, with high risk due to regulatory nature, are approved with more robust post-licensing requirements, the result of this study would be useful for it.

First, since many products in biophar- maceutical industry, with high risk due to regulatory nature, are approved with more robust post-licensing requirements, the result of this study would be useful for it. License con- tract consist of the upfront payment which guarantees 5–20% of entire payment and milestone which is a contingent fee for each phase, loyalty based on sales volume after approval [33]. In particular, probability of success in the phase of clinical trials is an important factor in deciding whether or not to license, the size of it, and the timing of it. Therefore, considering the factors that affect the success of clinical trials is important for biotechnology companies, which are technology providers. For this reason, biotechnology firms face decision-making problem of at what stage the contract with big pharmaceutical companies or competent pharma- ceutical companies for late-stage technology commercializa- tion, can maximize profits. Decisions for technology transfer Table 12 Summary of the results Phase NME Biologicals Phase 1 Experience, success ratio, duration, relationship type Experience, success ratio Phase 2 Experience, success ratio, duration Experience, success ratio Phase 3 Success ratio, relationship type, nation, continent Success ratio Phase 4 Success ratio N/A Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 can determine the profits that biotechnology companies can earn in tens or hundreds of billions of units in the future, and sometimes affect survival of biotechnology firms, which has a weak financial structure. Therefore, this study will help biotechnology firm to decision making and licensing process for more robust post-licensing requirements. Second, organizations conducting and supporting clini- cal trials must, above all, make efforts to strengthen and accumulate qualitative capabilities. And, if necessary, a regulatory device to enhance the project management capa- bilities of clinical trial organizations is also needed. This study implies the importance of capacity building through accumulation in clinical trials. Clinical trials require vari- ous project management skills such as design of clinical trials, human resources management, budget management, process management, risk management, data management, and portfolio management [34]. Competitive advantage of these things does not appear easily, but happen through the accumulation of experience and trials. Even if a clini- cal trial project ends in failure, it should also be accept - able as an enhancement of the organization’s clinical trial management capability for the other success. Therefore, this study explains us that competency management for enhance quality of clinical trial through experiences is important for the success of a clinical trial, and to conduct a clinical trial through a sponsor and collaborator who has done it well. Third, the result of study suggests that in order to increase successes of clinical trials in phase 3, to cooperate with various organizations; sponsors and collaborators, and to consider national and continental consistency for commu- nications, are required. Since phase 3 clinical trials aim to secure effective evidence on a large scale, financing or collaborating is inevitably requested in many cases, and it can be said that the capacity to manage them is required. In addition, in order to succeed in such a huge clinical trial, coordination capabilities at the project level are considered to be important than anything else. Meanwhile, the results of this study emphasize the national and continental homo- geneity of cooperation in terms of communication for the success of the phase 3 clinical trials. This leads to the inter- pretation that the effectiveness of communication will be enhanced due to cultural, cognitive, and racial similarities at the regional level, which can increase the probability of clinical trial success. Nevertheless, caution is needed in interpreting the results of national and continental consistency for communications in phase 3 clinical trial, as they can be linked to the issue of health equity in clinical trials. Cooperation in clinical trials should proceed in the direction of securing evidences a high-level quality. Evidence with a high level of quality guarantees the universality of the subjects of clinical trials. Therefore, efforts in the aspect of communication are needed to proceed with phase 3 clinical trials to secure ethnic and social diversity. Health equity in clinical trials to increase the diversity of the population enrolled in clinical trials for new drugs, is one of the latest issues related to the success of clinical trials. For example, clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease (aducanumab) of which only 0.6 percent of partici- pant were black people and the recent controversy over the lack of diversity in COVID-19 vaccines highlighted the ongoing gap in clinical trials across disease domains [35]. There is a risk that potential negative aspects of health and economics outcomes may emerge from the lack of phase 3 clinical trials with diversity. This study has a several limitations and suggests future studies. First, this study"}

There is a risk that potential negative aspects of health and economics outcomes may emerge from the lack of phase 3 clinical trials with diversity. This study has a several limitations and suggests future studies. First, this study did not conduct qualitative analy - sis and consider structural model. Although this study was conducted from a quantitative point of view to overcome the limitations of previous qualitative case studies, ultimately a qualitative analysis needs to be added. Field studies from a microscopic point of view will be able to supplement the results derived from statistical analysis in detail. Further - more, structural model including latent variables in addition to the explanatory variables in this study can be considered. The structural relationship between these factors makes it possible to distinguish between direct and indirect factors, which can lead to richer interpretations. Second, a more meaningful analysis of success factors may be possible by analyzing the characteristics of each organization type through additive study, such as survey, of clinical trial success factors that were not covered in this study. The value chain of the biopharmaceutical industry has recently been fragmented. In past, organizations related to biopharmaceutical industry tried to integrate more func- tions on the value chain but they are concentrating on core capacity nowadays. Active collaboration network through open innovation catalyze this phenomenon. In particular, at a time when the importance of contract research organiza- tion (CRO) is highlighted due to the decline in R&D pro- ductivity in the global biopharmaceutical industry [36], an additional analysis of the relationship between cooperation between pharmaceutical companies and CRO and the suc- cess of clinical trials can be analyzed. Third, since the data in this study are from controlled clinical trials, they do not accurately provide implications for clinical research in the real world. Recently, efforts have been made to derive clinical evidence using real world data (RWD), and it is expected that various prob- lems such as securing subjects in clinical trials and lack of control groups, post-approval follow-up will be resolved [37, 38]. For example, if more data related to clinical trials to use artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning can be used, a clinical trial execution strategy suitable for each organization’s situation could be developed. AI can select proper patients for disease-related clinical trials, and AI can also design future clinical trial plan [39]. If it is Therapeutic Innovation & Regulatory Science 1 3 hard to set a control group, it can be set in an externally controlled or matched manner with RWD. It has the poten- tial to fill the evidence gap that randomized control trials (RCT) in clinical trials has not solved [40]. Fourth, since the outcome indicators of clinical trials are expanding not only to health effectiveness but also to the quality of life aspects, and clinical trials using smart devices are also increasing starting with digital transfor - mation revolution and COVID-19, it should be considered to discover additional explanatory variables in these cir - cumstances. Indicators related with quality of life in clini- cal trial, should be about patient-centeredness and take into account the patient’s habits, environments, and social determinants (e.g., income, occupation, housing, educa- tion, welfare, safety) [41 ]. In addition, on only objective metrics, but also awareness of changes from the past to the present about health in terms of subjective perception of patients, and expectations for the future are used as indica- tors of clinical trials. On the other hand, the trend of clinical trials is moving from testing institution leading, face-to-face, on-site moni- toring and passive patients to on-line process based, un-tact, remote-monitoring and active patients [33]. COVID-19 had also catapulted digital transformation of clinical trials, and this change brought the born of decentralized clinical trials (DCT). Inconvenience of mobility to clinical trial institute makes 40% of patient terminate clinical trials [42]. DCT minimize visit of patient, so retention rate can be improved. The role of patients on DCT process may be certainly dif- fered from the traditional clinical trials [43, 44]. Therefore, the discovery of indicators considering these new trends in clinical trials should be added in future studies.

Using a sample of 406 038 entries of clinical trial data for over 21 143 compounds from January 1, 2000 to October 31, 2015, we estimate aggregate clinical trial success rates and durations. We also compute disaggregated estimates across several trial features including disease type, clinical phase, industry or academic sponsor, biomarker presence, lead indication status, and time. In several cases, our results differ signiﬁcantly in detail from widely cited statistics. For example, oncology has a 3.4% success rate in our sample vs. 5.1% in prior studies. However, after declining to 1.7% in 2012, this rate has improved to 2.5% and 8.3% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In addition, trials that use biomarkers in patient-selection have higher overall success probabilities than trials without biomarkers.

I NTRODUCTION The probability of success (POS) of a clinical trial is critical for clinical researchers and biopharma investors to evaluate when making scientiﬁc and economic decisions. Prudent resource allocation relies on the accurate and timely assessment of risk. Without up-to-date estimates of the POS, however, investors may misjudge the risk and value of drug development, leading to lost opportunities for both investors and patients. One of the biggest challenges in estimating the success rate of clinical trials is access to accurate information on trial characteristics and outcomes. Gathering such data is expensive, time-consuming, and ∗To whom correspondence should be addressed. © The Author 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

W ONG AND OTHERS susceptible to error. Previous studies of success rates have been constrained by the data in several respects. Abrantes-Metz and others (2005) surveyed 2328 drugs using 3136 phase transitions (e.g., from Phase 1 to Phase 2 in the approval process), whileDiMasi and others (2010) studied 1316 drugs from just 50 companies. In the landmark study of this area,Hay and others (2014) analyzed 7372 development paths of 4451 drugs using 5820 phase transitions. In two recent papers,Smietana and others(2016) computed statistics using 17 358 phase transitions for 9200 compounds, whileThomas and others(2016) used 9985 phase transitions for 7455 clinical drug development programs. In contrast, ClinicalTrials.gov, the clinical trial repository maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), contains over 217 000 clinical trial entries submitted by various organizations as of July 1, 2016 (see www.clinicaltrials.gov). It is estimated that trained analysts would require tens of thousands of hours of labor to incorporate its full information manually to produce POS estimates. In this article, we construct estimates of the POS and other related risk characteristics of clinical trials using 406 038 entries of industry- and non-industry-sponsored trials, corresponding to 185 994 unique trials over 21 143 compounds from Informa Pharma Intelligence’s Trialtrove and Pharmaprojects databases from January 1, 2000 to October 31, 2015. This is the largest investigation thus far into clinical trial success rates and related parameters. To process this large amount of data, we develop an automated algorithm that traces the path of drug development, infers the phase transitions, and computes the POS statistics in hours. In this article, we introduce the “path-by-path” approach that traces the proportion of development paths that make it from one phase to the next. In contrast, extant literature uses what we call the “phase-by-phase” approach, which estimates the POS from a random sample of observed phase transitions.

This is the largest investigation thus far into clinical trial success rates and related parameters. To process this large amount of data, we develop an automated algorithm that traces the path of drug development, infers the phase transitions, and computes the POS statistics in hours. In this article, we introduce the “path-by-path” approach that traces the proportion of development paths that make it from one phase to the next. In contrast, extant literature uses what we call the “phase-by-phase” approach, which estimates the POS from a random sample of observed phase transitions. Apart from the gains in efﬁciency, our algorithmic approach allows us to perform previously infeasible computations, such as generating time-series estimates of POS and related parameters. We estimate aggregate success rates, completion rates (CRs), phase-transition probabilities, and trial durations, as well as more disaggregated measures across various dimensions such as clinical phase, disease, type of organization, and whether biomarkers are used. Before presenting these and other results, we begin by discussing our methodology and describing some features of our data set. 2. D ATA We use Citeline data provided by Informa Pharma Intelligence, a superset of the most commonly used data sources that combines individual clinical trial information from Trialtrove and drug approval data from Pharmaprojects. In addition to incorporating multiple data streams, including nightly feeds from ofﬁcial sources such as ClinicalTrials.gov, Citeline contains data from primary sources such as institutional press releases, ﬁnancial reports, study reports, and drug marketing label applications, and secondary sources such as analyst reports by consulting companies. Secondary sources are particularly important for reducing potential biases that may arise from the tendency of organizations to report only successful trials, especially those prior to the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, which requires all clinical trials to be registered and tracked via ClinicalTrials.gov. Our database contains information from both US and non-US sources. The database encodes each unique quartet of trial identiﬁcation number, drug, indication, and sponsor as a data point. As such, a single trial can be repeated as multiple data points. The trials range from January 1, 2000, to October 31, 2015, the latter being the date that we received the data set. After deleting 46 524 entries with missing dates and unidentiﬁed sponsors, and 1818 entries that ended before January 1, 2000, 406 038 data points remain. Of these, 34.7% (141 086) are industry sponsored and 65.3% (264 952) are non-industry sponsored. In our industry-sponsored analysis, we counted 41 040 development paths or 67 752 phase transitions after the imputation process. Figure S1 in Section A1 of thesupplementary material available at Biostatistics online contains an illustrative sample of the data set and some basic summary information.

Since these dates are required by our algorithm, we estimate them by assuming that trials lasted the median duration of all other trials with similar features. Only 14.6% (59 208) of the data points required the estimation of end-dates. 3. M ODELING THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS To avoid confusion and facilitate the comparison of our results with those in the extant literature, we begin by deﬁning several key terms. A drug development program is the investigation of a particular drug for a single indication (see top diagram of Figure S2 of thesupplementary material available atBiostatistics online). A drug development program is said to be in Phasei if it has at least one Phasei clinical trial. If a Phase i clinical trial concludes and its objectives are met, this trial is said to be completed. If it is terminated prematurely for any reason, except in the case that it has positive results, the trial is categorized as failed. Conditioned on one or more trial(s) being completed, the sponsor can choose to either pursue Phase i + 1 trials, or simply terminate development. If the company chooses the former option, the drug development program is categorized as a success in Phasei, otherwise, it will be categorized as terminated in Phase i. See Figure S2 (bottom) of thesupplementary material available at Biostatistics online for an illustration. The POS for a given Phasei, denoted by POS i,i+1, is deﬁned as the probability that the drug development program advances to the next phase. The probability of getting a drug development program in Phase i through to approval is denoted by POS i,APP. Hence the overall probability of success—moving a drug from Phase 1 to approval, whichHay and others(2014) calls the likelihood of approval (LOA)—is POS1,APP. The proper interpretation of drug development programs from clinical trial data requires some under- standing of the drug development process, especially in cases of missing data. This is particularly important for estimating a drug candidate’s POS 1,APP, which is typically estimated by multiplying the empirical POS of Phase 1 (safety), 2 (efﬁcacy for a given indication), and 3 (efﬁcacy for larger populations and against alternatives) trials. If, for example, Phase 2 data are missing for certain approved drugs, the estimated POS 1,APP would be biased downward. Here, we take a different approach to estimating POSs. Consider an idealized"}

If, for example, Phase 2 data are missing for certain approved drugs, the estimated POS 1,APP would be biased downward. Here, we take a different approach to estimating POSs. Consider an idealized process in which every drug development program passes through Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials, in this order. This is plausible, since each of these stages involves distinct predeﬁned tests, all of which are required by regulators in any new drug application (NDA). If we observe data for Phases 1 and 3 but not Phase 2 for a given drug-indication pair, our idealized process implies that there was at least one Phase 2 trial that occurred, but is missing from our data set. Accordingly, we impute the successful completion of Phase 2 in these cases. There exist some cases where Phase 2 trials are skipped, as with the recent example of Aducanumab (BIIB037), Biogen’s Alzheimer’s candidate, as reported byRoot (2014). Since skipping Phase 2 trials is motivated by compelling Phase 1 data, imputing the successful completion of Phase 2 trials in these cases to trace drug development paths may not be a bad approximation. In addition, we make the standard assumption that Phase 1/2 and Phase 2/3 trials are to be considered as Phase 2 and Phase 3, respectively. These assumptions allow us to more accurately reconstruct ‘drug development paths’ for individual drug-indication pairs, which in turn yield more accurate POS estimates. Letn j be the number of drug development paths with observed Phasej trials, and nj s be the number of drug development paths where we observe phase transitions of states of Phase j (deﬁned below). s = ⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩ ip, if all the trials are in progress t, if the program failed to proceed to phase i + 1 (i.e., terminated) m, if the phase transition can be inferred to be missing Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524 by Mass Inst Tech user on 22 February 2019 4C . H . W ONG AND OTHERS Equation 3.1 is the conservation law for drug development paths in Phasej + 1. nj+1 = nj + nj m − nj ip − nj t ∀j = 1, 2, 3 (3.1) The POS from any one state to the next, POSj,j+1, is thus the ratio of the number of drug development projects in Phasej + 1, both observed and non-observed, to the number of drug development projects in Phase j, both observed and non-observed: POSj,j+1(Path-by-Path) = nj+1 nj + nj m − nj ip (3.2) Given our model, we can now compute POS1,APP by ﬁnding the proportion of development paths that made it from Phase 1 to Approval: POS1,APP(Path-by-Path) = nApproval n1 + n1 m − n1 ip − n2 ip − n3 ip (3.3) We term this the ‘path-by-path’ approach. In contrast, extant papers deﬁne the phase transition probabil- ity as the ratio of observed phase transitions to the number of observed drug development programs in Phase i and multiply the individual phase probabilities to estimate the overall POS. We term this the ‘phase- by-phase’ approach, which we shall differentiate from the path-by-path computation by a superscript p as follows: POS p j,j+1 = nj+1 − nj m nj − nj ip (3.4) POSp 1,APP = ∏ j∈{1,2,3} POSp j,j+1 (3.5) Implicit in the path-by-path computation method is the assumption that we have relatively complete information about the trials involved in drug development programs. This is true of our data set, as we are analyzing relatively recent years where trial pre-registration is a prerequisite for publication in major medical journals and use of the studies as supporting evidence for drug applications. However, this assumption breaks down when we look at short windows of duration, for example, in a rolling window analysis to estimate the change in the POS over time. In such cases, we default back to the ‘phase-by-phase’ estimation to get an insight into the trend. This is done by considering only those drug development programs with phases that ended betweent 1 and t2 in the computation of the POS. POSp j,j+1(t1, t2) = nj+1(t1, t2) − nj m(t1, t2) nj (t1, t2) − nj ip(t1, t2) (3.6) POSp 1,APP(t1, t2) = ∏ j∈{1,2,3} POSp j,j+1(t1, t2) (3.7) We further note that if no phase transitions are missing, the path-by-path and phase-by-phase methods should produce the same results, but the former will be more representative of actual approval rates if Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524 by Mass Inst Tech user on 22 February 2019 Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters 5 phase transitions are missing.

We elaborate on this in Section A2 of thesupplementary material available at Biostatistics online. Given our development-path framework, we can compute the POS using an algorithm that recursively considers all possible drug-indication pairs and determines the maximum observed phase. Reaching Phase i would imply that all lower phases were completed. To determine if a drug development program has been terminated in the last observed phase or is still ongoing, we use a simple heuristic: if the time elapsed between the end date of the most recent Phasei and the end of our sample exceeds a certain threshold t i, we conclude that the trial has terminated. Based on practical considerations, we setti to be 360, 540, and 900 days for Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For example, we assume that it takes approximately 6 months to prepare documents for an NDA ﬁling after a Phase 3 trial has been completed. Since the FDA has a 6-month period to decide if it wishes to follow-up on a ﬁling, and an additional 18 months to deliver a verdict, this places the overall time between Phase 3 and Approval to about 30 months, hence we set t 3 = 900 days. A pseudo-code for the algorithm is given in Figure S5 in Section A3 of thesupplementary material available atBiostatistics online. In summary, our algorithm allows us to impute missing trial data, and by counting the number of phase transitions, we can estimate the phase and overall POS. 4. R ESUL TS 4.1. POS for all drugs and indications Table 1 contains our estimates of the aggregate POS for each clinical phase across all indications. Corresponding estimates from the prior literature are also included for comparison. We ﬁnd that 13.8% of all drug development programs eventually lead to approval, which is higher than the 10.4% reported by Hay and others (2014) and the 9.6% reported byThomas and others (2016). The overall POS pre- sented in this study, Hay and others (2014), and Thomas and others (2016) are much higher than the 1% to 3% that is colloquially seen as it is conditioned on the drug development program entering Phase 1. Our phase-speciﬁc POS estimates are higher in all phases. The largest increase is seen in POS 2,3, where we obtained a value of 58.3% compared to 32.4% in Hay and others (2014) and 30.7% in Thomas and others (2016). These differences may be due to our method of imputing missing clinical trials. Table 2 contains phase and overall POS estimates by therapeutic group. The overall POS (POS1,APP) ranges from a minimum of 3.4% for oncology to a maximum of 33.4% for vaccines (infectious disease). The overall POS for oncology drug development programs is about two-thirds the previously reported estimates of 5.1% inThomas and others(2016) and 6.7% inHay and others(2014). A signiﬁcantly different pattern emerges when we consider the phase POS for lead indications. The overall POS (POS1,APP) increases when considering only lead indications, which is in line with the ﬁndings by Hay and others(2014). However, while we ﬁnd an increase in the POS for Phase 1 (POS1,2) and Phase 3 (POS3,APP), we ﬁnd a decrease in the POS for Phase 2 (POS2,3) when looking only at lead indications. The POS for lead indications may be lower than the POS for all indications if a company initiates clinical trials for many indications, and most of them move on to the next phase. Conversely, the POS for lead indications may be higher if many of the initiated clinical trials for the same drug fail. The practice of initiating clinical trials for multiple indications using the same drug is prevalent in the industry, as documented in Table S2 in Section A5 of thesupplementary materialavailable atBiostatistics online. The relative performance of the various therapeutic groups remains the same when considering only lead indications, with oncology remaining the lowest performing group at 11.4% for POS 1,APP. Finally, the overall POS for individual therapeutic groups when considering only lead indications shows mixed directions in comparison to the respective overall POS speciﬁc to the indication.

This is done by modifying Algorithm 1 (see Figure S5 ofsupplementary materialavailable atBiostatistics online) to increment counts only if there exists a biomarker trial in that phase. Furthermore, as 92.3% of the trials using biomarkers in our database are observed only on or after January 1, 2005, we do not include trials before this date to ensure a fair comparison of the POS between trials that do and do not use biomarkers. Table 3 shows only trials that use biomarkers to stratify patients. As can be seen, there is substantial variation in the use of biomarkers across therapeutic areas. Biomarkers are seldom used outside of oncol- ogy. Trials using biomarkers exhibit almost twice the overall POS (POS 1,APP) compared to trials without biomarkers (10.3% vs. 5.5%). While the use of biomarkers in the stratiﬁcation of patients improves the POS in all phases, it is most signiﬁcant in Phases 1 and 2. (We caution against over-interpreting the results for therapeutic areas outside oncology due to their small sample size.) These ﬁndings are similar in spirit to the analysis byThomas and others (2016), which also found substantial improvement in the overall POS when biomarkers were used. However, when we expanded the deﬁnition of a biomarker trial to include trials with the objective of evaluating or identifying the use of any novel biomarker as an indicator of therapeutic efﬁcacy or toxicity, in addition to the selection of patients, we obtained signiﬁcantly different results (see Table S3 in Section A6 of the supplementary material available at Biostatistics online). Instead of ﬁnding a huge increase in the overall POS, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference. It may be that trials that attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of biomarkers are more likely to fail, leading to a lower overall POS compared to trials that only use biomarkers in patient stratiﬁcation. Comparison of the two tables shows that new biomarkers are being evaluated in all therapeutic areas. We provide a more detailed analysis of the differences between our analysis andThomas and others (2016) in Section A7 of thesupplementary material available atBiostatistics online. 4.3. POS of orphan drugs trials Table 4 contains POS estimates for drugs that treat rare diseases, also known as ‘orphan drugs’. The classiﬁcations for rare diseases are obtained from both EU and US rare disease resources: OrphaNet and NIH GARD. Rare diseases may belong to any therapeutic group, and the computation of the statistics for orphan drugs is identical to that used for the trials in Table2. Broadly speaking, orphan drug development has signiﬁcantly lower success rates, with only 6.2% of drug development projects reaching the market. Comparing these results against those for all drug development, we see that, while the Phase 1 POS increases from 66.4% to 75.9%, the Phase 2 and Phase 3 success rates fall from 58.3% to 48.8% and from 59.0% to 46.7%, respectively, leading to a decline in the overall POS. Our data reveal that most orphan drug trials are in oncology. Our overall POS of 6.2% is much lower than the 25.3% reported inThomas and others(2016). This discrepancy can be attributed to their identiﬁcation of only non-oncology indications as ‘rare diseases’ and their use of the phase-by-phase method of computing Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524 by Mass Inst Tech user on 22 February 2019 Table 3.

We deﬁne the 3-year window to be January 1 in year t − 2 to December 31 in yeart, with the exception of the last window, which terminates on October 31, 2015, the day we received the snapshot of the data. Caution must be exercised in interpreting the results for 2015, which very likely overestimate the true success rates due to boundary effects. As insufﬁcient time has passed to allow our algorithm to conclude that a trial has failed, we obtain a smaller denominator in our computation of probabilities, translating to an upward bias in the success rates for that year. We ﬁnd that the overall success rate for all drug development programs did decrease between 2005 (11.2%) and 2013 (5.2%), as anecdotal reports suggest. However, this decline reversed after 2013 (see Figure 1). The overall success rate is mainly driven by changes in POS 1,2 and POS2,3. The timing of the upward trend coincides with the time period during which the FDA has been approving more novel drugs, Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524 by Mass Inst Tech user on 22 February 2019 Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters 11 Fig. 1.

This POS is computed using the phase-by-phase method, our adaptation ofHay and others(2014)’ methodology, which reports the proportion of phase transitions that advances to the next phase. The algorithm from Figure S5 in the Supplementary Material is not used, as it would overestimate the phase success if applied to a short window. The result for 2015 has to be treated with caution, as boundary effects increase the success rates artiﬁcially. compared to the historical mean (seeU.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, 2016). Our results are not directly comparable withSmietana and others(2016) because it used a different aggregation method and considered only lead indications. The overall POSs across the different therapeutic groups move in tandem over time. There are some minor deviations, such as the POS of drugs and vaccines for infectious diseases increasing between 2005 and 2007. Nonetheless, these results suggest that there is a systemic factor driving the trends over time.

W ONG AND OTHERS Numerical results of our analysis are provided in Section A8 of thesupplementary material available at Biostatistics online. 4.5. Other results We quantify other aspects of clinical drug development including CRs, duration, and POS for non-industry- sponsored trials, which we summarize here (see Sections A9 through A14 in thesupplementary material available atBiostatistics online for details). We ﬁnd that the average number of Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, and Phase 4 trials per drug development path are 1.7, 2.0, 2.8, and 3.2, respectively. The high number of Phase 4 trials per development path is surprising, as it indicates that many approved drugs have to conduct massive post-marketing studies to identify and evaluate long-term side effects. This may potentially increase drug development costs and lower the proﬁtability of the drugs in the long run. The CR at Phase i refers to the proportion of Phase i trials that are tagged as completed. Our data show that the CRs for all clinical trials are 91.4%, 81.1%, 84.9%, and 87.2% for Phases 1 through 4, respectively. While Phase 3 trials are often riskier and costlier, they have a higher CR than Phase 2 trials. This may be because Phase 3 trials are given higher priority within organizations. Oncology trials have lower CRs across all phases, with only 73.9% of the trials reaching completion. This points to a possible bottleneck in the development of oncology drugs. Trial length is a key determinant of the ﬁnancial risk and reward of drug development projects. We provide updated estimates for the duration of clinical trials using our data set. We ﬁnd that the median clinical trial durations are 1.6, 2.9, and 3.8 years, for trials in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Our ﬁndings for Phase 3 are higher than Martin and others (2017), but lower for Phase 1. The clinical cycle times for Phase 2 trials are similar. By summing up the individual durations across Phases 1 through 3 and across therapeutic area, we ﬁnd that the median time spent in the clinic ranged from 5.9 to 7.2 years for non-oncology trials, but the median duration for oncology trials was 13.1 years.

This suggests higher risks in oncology projects and may explain their lower approval rate. Similar toAbrantes-Metz and others (2005), we examine whether there is a difference between trials that fail to transition to the next phase of drug development (‘terminated’) and those that transition successfully (‘advanced’). Terminated Phase 2 trials tend to conclude 8.1 months earlier than advanced Phase 2 trials. However, terminated Phase 3 trials concluded about 3.2 months after advanced Phase 3 trials. The difference between terminated and advanced Phase 1 trials is insigniﬁcant. By constructing a time series using 5-year rolling windows, we see that these differences (or lack thereof) have remained constant over time. The CRs for non-industry sponsored trials vs. industry-sponsored trials are higher for Phases 2 and 4, virtually identical for Phase 3, and lower for Phase 1. This mixed result suggests that synergies between industry and non-industry organizations can be exploited through collaboration. To evaluate this intuition, we compute the POS of drug development projects conditioned on the number of non-industry partners and ﬁnd an 11.3 percentage point increase in the POS when non-industry partners are involved. This result extends the ﬁndings by Danzon and others (2005), underscoring the beneﬁts of greater collaboration between the pharmaceutical industry and organizations outside the industry. 5. R OBUSTNESS TEST In this article, we attempt to use trial data to trace every drug/indication/sponsor triplet from ﬁrst trial to last. While our method is arguably more accurate than earlier ones, it faces other issues such as the need to process machine-readable trial information using heuristics, and deal with corrupted and missing data Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/biostatistics/kxx069/4817524 by Mass Inst Tech user on 22 February 2019 Estimation of clinical trial success rates and related parameters 13 by interpolation and estimation, which may introduce errors of their own. We perform two experiments to test the robustness and stability of our algorithm across different time windows and data sets. In our ﬁrst experiment, we attempt to replicateThomas and others(2016) by using only data between 2006 and 2015. We ﬁnd that the POS from the truncated sample differs from the full sample by less than 2.1 percentage points for all therapeutic groups, while the overall POS is 0.6 percentage points lower than the overall POS of the full sample. Compared toThomas and others(2016), we ﬁnd that our phase POS is higher in Phases 1 and 2, but lower in Phase 3, due to our use of the path-by-path method for calculating the POS. Our 13.8% overall POS is higher than their 9.6%. In our second experiment, we run our algorithm using only data tagged as originating from ClinicalTri- als.gov. The computed success rates are comparable to those from our original data set, with deviations of less than 2.1 percentage points despite having approximately 30% fewer data points. This indicates that our algorithm produces similar results even when a different data set is used. Details of our robustness results are provided in Section A15 of thesupplementary material available atBiostatistics online. 6. D ISCUSSION Compared withHay and others(2014) andThomas and others(2016), we obtained higher POS estimates for all phases. Our numbers will result in a lower estimated drug development cost, especially in Phase 3, where the cost of conducting a trial dominates those of other phases. Looking at the trend of POS over time, we see that the there is a decrease between 2005 and 2013, and an increase thereafter. There are many possible reasons for the uptick in the later years. As some observers have suggested, companies may have been more careful with licensing compounds and gotten better at identifying potential failures (see Smietana and others, 2016), thus leading to higher productivity. We propose two other possible reasons for the trend. Firstly, the increased use of biomarkers in recent years could have contributed to the trend by allowing companies to target drugs at patients who are more likely to produce a positive response. Secondly, it is also possible that we are simply observing a new wave of medical breakthroughs, such as in the area of immunotherapy; for example, in the short span of just 11 months between July 2014 and June 2015, Nivolumab was approved on ﬁve different occasions for various indications in multiple markets. We found that trials using biomarkers for patient stratiﬁcation have higher success rates, especially in the area of oncology. Given the active development of biomarkers for the area of oncology, we expect that the dismal approval rates of oncology will improve. However, our expectations are tempered by the fact that the"}

However, our expectations are tempered by the fact that the median time to completion for oncology trials is twice as long as for non-oncology trials, signifying increased cost and risk. We believe these revised estimates of the success rates of clinical trials will provide greater risk transparency to drug developers, investors, policymakers, and patients. We hope that with this information, all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem will be able to make more informed decisions regarding the design and implementation of clinical trials.

METHODS This is a cross-sectional study with clinical trial information from the largest registration database ClinicalTrials.gov. Enrollment success rate was deﬁned as actual enrollment greater or equal to 85% of the estimated enrollment goal. The association between trial characteristics and enrollment success was evaluated using the multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS A total of 4,004 trials in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were included. The overall enrollment success rate was 49.1%. Compared with 2008-2010 (51.5%) and 2011-2013 (52.1%), the enrollment success rate is lower in 2014-2016 (46.5%) and 2017-2019 (36.4%). Regression analyses found trial activation year, phase I, phase I/phase II, and phase II (v phase III), sponsor agency of government (v industry), not requiring healthy volunteers, and estimated enrollment of 50-100, 100-200, 200, and >500 (v 0-50) were associated with a lower enrollment success rate (P < .05). However, trials with placebo comparator, ≥5 locations (v 1 location), and a higher number of secondary end points (eg,≥5 v 0) were associated with a higher enrollment success rate (P < .05). The AUC for prediction of theﬁnal logistic regression models for all trials and speciﬁc trial groups ranged from 0.69 to 0.76. CONCLUSION This large-scale study supports a lower enrollment success rate over years in cancer clinical trials. Identiﬁed factors for enrollment success can be used to develop and improve recruitment strategies for future cancer trials. INTRODUCTION Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and the main source for disease burden globally. 1 Innovations from clinical trials play a key role in the treatment of cancer. Through clinical trials, the innovations can be evaluated rigorously before possible ap- proval and use in clinical practice, to cure the disease, prolong patient survival, and/or improve quality of life. 2 At the same time, eligible patients enrolled in the trials could have a chance to experience clinical beneﬁts from the newest innovations before the regulatory approval for application in practice. Despite the importance of cancer trials, ensuring success of patient enrollment is challenging. Studies showed nearly 35% of phase III cancer trials were closed because of in- sufﬁcient enrollment. 3,4 Another study found that 18% of 4,269 phase I-III cancer trials were classiﬁed as slow en- rolling, deﬁned as less than two participants per year.5 Ac- cordingly, insufﬁcient enrollment is a major barrier to progress in clinical trials, causing a waste of both time and money, and ultimately delaying promising treatments for patients. In fact, there are sufﬁcient number of patients eligible for participation in clinical trials but only a few of them do so. 6 Therefore, we conduct this large-scale, cross-sectional study investigating the prevalence of enrollment success rate and its factors among clinical trials for cancers. From this work, we expect that trialists including oncologists, researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders could take more attention to enrollment success in trials for cancers, especially considering identiﬁed factors for improving en- rollment in future trials. METHODS Data Source and Setting This cross-sectional study was conducted based on Clin- icalTrials.gov, the largest clinical trial database currently run ACCOMPANYING CONTENT Appendix Accepted August 15, 2023 Published October 4, 2023 JCO Oncol Pract 19:1058-1068 © 2023 by American Society of Clinical Oncology View Online Article 1058 | Volume 19, Issue 11 |ascopubs.org/journal/op by the US National Library of Medicine. ClinicalTrials.gov was established in 2000. The database experienced a major expansion after the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA) was executed in 2007, which re- quired all drug, biological, and device trials, besides phase I clinical trials, to be registered into the ClinicalTrials.gov database. 7 This publicly accessible web-based registry comprises a full-scale baseline characteristic of a clinical trial, including recruiting status, disease condition, phase of the study, eligibility criteria, location, etc, allowing us to conduct such a study as generalizable as possible. Data Extraction and Trial Selection To extract all needed trial information from the website, we separated the progress into two parts using R (Version 3.6.1). First, we used an R library (rclinicaltrials 8) to download all possible information. During this process, however, the extracted data did not contain two main variables, the number of patients in estimated enrollment and the actual enrollment, for calculating enrollment success rate, the outcome of this study. Therefore, we conducted the second part of the extraction using web scraping methods in R to extract both variables. Data extraction was completed on June 6, 2022, on the basis of the trial activation year of 2008-2019. The selection for the start year (2008) was in concordance with the FDAAA intro- duced in 2007, so that trials started after 2008 should have completer and more robust information as recorded in the registration website. The selection for the ending year (2019) was given that many trials started after 2019 are still ongoing, without enrollment completion;particularly, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 9-12 Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were selected according to their disease burden— all of them are of the topﬁve cancer types with the highest mortality rate and disability-adjusted life-years among all cancer types in the"}

The selection for the ending year (2019) was given that many trials started after 2019 are still ongoing, without enrollment completion;particularly, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 9-12 Breast, lung, and colorectal cancers were selected according to their disease burden— all of them are of the topﬁve cancer types with the highest mortality rate and disability-adjusted life-years among all cancer types in the globe. 1 Exclusion criteria were trials with completion date of 2020 and afterward; trials with no infor- mation in the Study Information dataframe, which contains key variables including trial activation date, number of patients in estimated enrollment, and actual enrollment; trials whose study type is not interventional; and trials with undeﬁned enrollment names and unknown (marked as NA) phase status. Outcome Our outcome is enrollment success. It is a binary variable, deﬁned as actual patient enrollment is≥85% of the esti- mated patient enrollment goal of the trial (AppendixTable A1, online only). The rationale for using 85% as the cutoff value is that we could not conclude enrollment unsuccessful if the actual enrollment number were below the estimated number by a few participants. The cutoff of 85% gives the outcome deﬁnition with an acceptable margin to avoid the mentioned issue. According to the deﬁnition, we calculated the prevalence of enrollment success as the number of trials with enrollment success divided by the total number of included trials. Exposure To investigate the factor for enrollment success, the following trial characteristics were used as exposure: trial activation year, cancer type, number of conditions, phase, intervention type, number of interventions, type of intervention drug, lead sponsor agency, number of sponsors, eligibility of healthy volunteers, minimum age and maximum age, type of arms, number of arms, number of primary outcomes, number of secondary outcomes, number of countries, number of loca- tions, and number of patients in estimated enrollment. In addition, recruitment status was extracted. CONTEXT Key Objective To investigate the prevalence of enrollment success rate, how its trend has been over time, and what factors associated with the enrollment success rate are in cancer clinical trials. Knowledge Generated The enrollment success rate was 49.1% in 2008-2019 with a decreasing tendency over time. A set of risk and preventive factors were found for the enrollment success rate on the basis of multivariable regression models with good prediction accuracy. Relevance The low and decreasing enrollment success rate should receive a close attention by oncologists, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Our analysis leads to a prediction model on enrollment success based on the trial-level information collected prior to trial activation; the variables that are strongly associated with the enrollment success rate and meanwhile are manipulable can be used by the trial investigators as actionable strategy to improve the enrollment success rate in cancer clinical trials. JCO Oncology Practice ascopubs.org/journal/op | Volume 19, Issue 11 |1059 Enrolment Success, Factors and Prediction Models in Cancer Trials For the lead sponsor agency, the website has four categories: NIH, US Fed, industry, and other. We reclassiﬁed the cate- gories by combining NIH and US Fed as government, and subdividing other into research institute and others by searching for keywords ( “University,”“ Center,” “Institute,”“ Group,”“ Hospital,” and “Network”) that could distinguish most of the research institutes from all the sponsors. For the type of intervention drug, we chose the top ﬁve most frequent types in the database. Statistical Analysis The association of trial characteristics with enrollment success (yes or no) wasﬁrst evaluated via univariate analyses, using the chi-square test for categorical variables and the Kruskal- Wallis test for continuous variables. The association was further evaluated via the multivariable logistic regression model, adjusted for all the exposure variables mentioned above. The measure is the odds ratio: the point estimate and 95% CIs <1 indicate risk factors lowering the enrollment success rate. The above model was conducted for all included trials, trials by cancer type (breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer) and by phase (phase I, phase II, phase III), as well as trials for drugs only. Last, the prediction accuracy for each model was measured by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). RESULTS From a total of 24,886 trials identiﬁed in the database for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers, 4,004 trials were included (Fig 1). AppendixTable A2presents the details of trial char- acteristics. Among all trials, 37.2%, 32.6%, and 15.5%, re- spectively, were for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers only, the rest were the trials for multiple tumor types including any of the three cancers; 26%, 44.2%, and 13.7% were phase I, phase II, and phase III trials, respectively; 11.9%, 32.0%, 41.5%, and 14.6% were mainly sponsored by government, research institutes, industry, and others, respectively.

AppendixTables A3 and A4 present the characteristics by cancer type and by phase, respectively; AppendixTable A5is for drug trials. Prevalence of Enrollment Success Rate The prevalence and the trend of enrollment success rate are shown inFigure 2. The overall enrollment success rate for all included trials was 49.1%. Compared with 2008-2010 (51.5%) and 2011-2013 (52.1%), enrollment success rate was lower in 2014-2016 (46.5%) and 2017-2019 (36.4%). The decreasing trend exists regardless of trials by cancer type and lead sponsor agency, as well as in phase I, phase II, bio- logical, drug, and radiation trials, respectively. The enroll- ment success rate in phase III trials remained stable over time: 63.9% in 2008-2020, 64.1% in 2011-2013, 69.2% in 2013-2016, and 60.6% in 2017-2019. The rate in trials sponsored by government was low: 37.9% in all years, and 43.0%, 35.7%, 33.3%, and 21.7% in 2008-2010, 2011-2013, 2014-2016, and 2017-2019, respectively. Factors for Enrollment Success Rate Table 1presents the multivariable logistic regression results on the associations between trial characteristics and en- rollment success in all trials and trials for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers; AppendixTable A6presents the results in phase I, phase II, phase III, and drug trials. For all trials, risk factors were trial activation year; phase I, phase I/phase II, phase II, and phase II/phase III trials, compared with phase III trials; radiation trials; trials with two interventions, compared with trials with 1 intervention; lead sponsor agencies of government and other, compared with industry; trials not requiring healthy volunteers; trials with patients recruited from an unknown number of countries, compared with one country; and estimated enrollment of 50-100, 100-200, 200-500, and >500 patients, compared with 0-50 patients. The risk factors of trial activation year, phase I, phase I/phase II, and phase II, sponsor agency of government, not requiring healthy volunteers, and estimated enrollment of 50-100, 100-200, 200, and >500 patients were still found in majorities of trials by cancer type and phase (I, II, III; AppendixTable A6)a sw e l la sd r u gt r i a l s(Table 1; Fig 3). Preventive factors associated with a higher enrollment success rate in all trials were trials for colorectal cancer; trials for device; randomized trials, compared with non- randomized trials; trials with active comparator and placebo comparator arms; trials with≥3 arms, compared with two arms; trials with two and≥5 secondary end points, compared with 0 secondary end points; and trials with≥5 locations, compared with one location (Table 1). The factors of trials with placebo comparator,≥5 locations, and trials with≥5 secondary end points were also found in majorities of trials by cancer type and phase (I, II, III; AppendixTable A6) as well as drug trials (Table 1; Fig 3). Model Prediction The prediction score, AUC, of the logistic regression model for all trials was 0.69. The AUC for breast, lung, colorectal, phase I, phase II, phase III, and drug trials was 0.71, 0.74, 0.74, 0.72, 0.69, 0.76, and 0.70, respectively. DISCUSSION This is a large-scale, cross-sectional study investigating the prevalence of enrollment success rate and its risk and pre- ventive factors among clinical trials for breast, lung, and colorectal cancers— the ones accounting for the highest disease burden among all cancer types. Overall, the study estimated the enrollment success rate as <50% among all the included trials in 2008-2019; speciﬁcally, the trend pre- sented was decreasing over time, with 36.39% in 2017-2019. Also, the study identiﬁed risk and preventive factors for enrollment success rate. Important risk factors included trial activation year, phase I, phase I/phase II, and phase II (v phase III), sponsor agency of government (v industry), not requiring healthy volunteers, and estimated enrollment of 50-100, 100-200, 200, and >500 (v 0-50); preventive factors 1060 | © 2023 by American Society of Clinical Oncology Zhang et al included placebo comparator,≥5 locations (v one location), and a higher number of secondary end points (eg,≥5 v 0). The ﬁnal regression models for investigating the above associations present a decent prediction, with AUC in all trials and trials by characteristic ranging from 0.69 to 0.76. Our study highlights the undesirable enrollment success rate in clinical trials for cancers, especially its decreasing ten- dency. Of note, theseﬁndings were based on the trials before the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we hold the concern about enrollment success rate in the currently ongoing trials, especially given the published evidence supporting the difﬁculties in trial enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 9-12 Continuous investigations on en- rollment success are needed whenever more robust data could be available for the trials started or completed during the COVID-19 years. Nevertheless, among the results for different trials, the enrollment success rate in phase III trials was high— ranging from 60.6% to 69.2% throughout the years of 2008-2019 —"}

Nevertheless, among the results for different trials, the enrollment success rate in phase III trials was high— ranging from 60.6% to 69.2% throughout the years of 2008-2019 — which echoes the results in two previous studies on phase III trials in the same years of 1993-2002: 63% of enrollment success rate in 248 trials sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute, 4 and 66% in 238 trials of the US Clinical Trials Cooperative Groups.3 Regarding risk factors, speciﬁcally, the lower enrollment success rates in phase I and II trials should be of concern. This is given that the trials in both phases are the corner- stone of developing phase III trials from which, in general, the innovations could be considered for application in real- world practice. As such, enough patient enrollment ensures the rigor before being considered for and evaluated in phase III trials. Furthermore, we are surprised to see the difference in the enrollment success rate between lead sponsor agencies. Speciﬁcally, the rate in government-sponsored trials is very low, decreasing from 43.0% in 2008-2010 to 21.7% in 2017-2019. Such results should be scrutinized by the public, as the investment from government and the decision for such investment are made in collaboration with well- recognized scholars. Last, the estimated enrollment of over 50 patients is a risk factor; as more patients are expected to be enrolled, there would be higher cost and difﬁculty in trial conduction. In addition, such results in the majority of these models sug- gest a higher number of estimated patients leads to a higher risk that the trial could not achieve the enrollment target number. In addition to the above risk factors, structural and clinical barriers have been well studied. 13,14 For example, a trial might not be available at the collaborating centers; patients may be ineligible for an available trial; and en- rollment rates are different between academic and com- munity settings. 13 Other common causes of enrollment failure are narrow eligibility criteria, overestimate of All unique breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectual cancer trials with identifiable characteristics (e.g., study start date, enrollment estimates) in ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 24,835) (n = 9,637) (n = 7,611) (n = 5,552) (n = 4,004) Trials whose study type is not interventional (n = 2,026) Trials with phase NA (n = 1,548) Trials with undefined enrollment name combinations (n = 2,059) Trials with start year before 2008 or with completion date after December 31, 2019 (n = 15,198) Excluded Excluded Excluded Excluded FIG 1.

Relying on ClinicalTrials.gov, the study captured a large variety of clinical trial information for the cancers, applied the information to the prevalence and trend of enrollment success rate, evaluated its factors, and de- veloped prediction models for enrollment success rate for the included trials. Regarding limitations, however, this study is strongly subjective to the robustness of data col- lection on ClinicalTrials.gov. Speciﬁcally, although Clinical- Trials.gov is the largest database for trial registration, our sample of trials cannot represent the whole of all trials registered and not registered in the globe, especially those conducted not in the United States. Also, the data quality and completeness depend on the trialists who submitted the trial data.

Otherwise, we would look at how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected enrollment success in cancer clinical trials, which deserves future investigations. In addition, our analysis was also subject to the availability of data information developed on ClinicalTrials.gov. Rather than patient level or health system level, speciﬁcally, the analysis was based on the information at the trial level but the amount of analysis should provide informative impli- cations as presented and discussed in the Result and Dis- cussion sections. Last, the decreasing tendency found in our study could be accounted for by the more registrations of clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov, including those without successful enrollment. However, the decreasing trend is consistent with the ﬁndings from other studies in the high failure rate of oncology trials because of low enrollment rate. 15,17,39,40 In fact, there are increasing number of new therapies, especially with the development of immunotherapy, 41,42 to be evaluated, and persistent barriers to enrollment and trial completion.13-18,39,40,43 As such, the low enrollment success rate found over the past decade should be paid attention to and be potentially improved by considering the factors as identiﬁed in this study. In conclusion, this large-scale, cross-sectional study supports a lower enrollment success rate over years in cancer clinical trials, regardless of cancer types and lead sponsor agencies, and trials by many other characteristics. The ﬁndings could be of concern to the public, especially trialists including oncologists, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Our analysis leads to a model with good prediction on enrollment success on the basis of the trial-level information collected before trial activation. The identiﬁed risk factors for enrollment success can be used to develop and improve recruit ment strategies for future cancer trials. AFFILIATIONS 1Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University,"}

References ................................................................................................ Executive summary It should be the aim of those conducting clinical trials to achieve complete capture of all data from all patients, including those who discontinue from treatment. Whilst it is unavoidable that some data are missing from all confirmatory clinical trials, it should be noted that just ignoring missing data is not an acceptable option when planning, conducting or interpreting the analysis of a confirmatory clinical trial. The reason for missing data and handling of missing data in the analysis represent critical factors in the regulatory assessment of all confirmatory clinical trials. The main focus of this guideline is issues associated with the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint where patients are followed up over time. However, by careful planning it is possible to reduce the amount of data that are missing. This is important because missing data are a potential source of bias when analysing data from clinical trials. Interpretation of the results of a trial is always problematic when the proportion of missing values is substantial. When this occurs, the uncertainty of the likely treatment effect can become such that it is not possible to conclude that evidence of efficacy has been established. In confirmatory trials the primary analysis is commonly performed on the full analysis set as this analysis is consistent with the intention to treat (ITT) principle. If data for some subjects are missing for the primary endpoint it is necessary to specify how all randomised patients can be included in the statistical analysis. However, there is no universally applicable method that adjusts the analysis to take into account that some values are missing, and different approaches may lead to different conclusions. To avoid concerns over data-driven selection of methods, it is essential to pre-specify the selected methods in the statistical section of the study protocol or analysis plan. Unfortunately, when there are missing data, all approaches to analysis rely on assumptions that cannot be verified. It should be noted that the strategy employed to handle missing values might in itself be a source of bias. A critical discussion of the number, timing, pattern, reason for and possible implications of missing values in efficacy and safety assessments should be included in the clinical report as a matter of routine. It will be useful to investigate the pattern of missing data in previous trials in the same or similar indications for related medicinal products. This could assist in identifying additional actions to minimise the amount of missing data during the conduct of the trial, the choice of the primary analysis method and in determining how missing data will be handled in this analysis. A positive regulatory decision must be based on an analysis where the possibility of important bias in favour of the experimental agent can be excluded. The justification for selecting a particular method should not be based primarily on the properties of the method under particular assumptions but on whether it is likely that it will provide an appropriate estimate for the comparison of primary regulatory interest in the circumstances of the trial under consideration.. An appropriate analysis would provide a point estimate that is unlikely to be biased in favour of experimental treatment to an important degree (under reasonable assumptions) and a confidence interval that does not underestimate the variability of the point estimate to an important extent. The type of bias that can critically affect interpretation depends upon the objective of the study (to show su periority, non-inferiority or equivalence). As the choice of primary analysis will be based on assumptions that cannot be verified it will almost always be necessary to investigate the robustness of trial results through appropriate sensitivity analyses that make different assumptions."}

Introduction (background) Missing data are a potential source of bias when analysing clinical trials. Interpretation of the results of a trial is always problematic when the proportion of missing values is substantial. This problem is only partially covered in ICH E9 (Statistical Principles of Clinical Trials). There are many possible reasons for missing data (e.g. patient refusal to continue in the study, patient withdrawals due to treatment failure, treatment success or adverse events, patients moving), only some of which are related to study treatment. Different degrees of data incompleteness can occur, i.e. measurements may be available only at baseline, or measurements may be missing at baseline, or may be missing for one, several or all follow-up assessments. Even if a patient completes the study, some data may remain simply unreported or uncollected. In general this document concentrates on how to handle the situation where data are missing due to patients withdrawing from a trial. Ignoring missing data in the analysis violates the strict ITT principle which requires measurement and analysis of all patient outcomes regardless of protocol adherence. This principle is of critical importance as confirmatory clinical trials should estimate the effect of the experimental intervention in the population of patients with greatest external vali dity and not the effect in the unrealistic scenario 3/12 where all patients receive treatment with full compliance to the treatment schedule and with a complete follow-up as per protocol. Full set analysis generally requires the imputation of values or modelling for the unrecorded data. Even the per protocol analyses might also require the use of some method of handling missing data for patients who have no major protocol violations or deviations but, for some reason, have data not recorded. The manner in which missing data are handled can have, depending upon the amount and type of missing data, a crucial influence on the final results of a clinical trial and on the certainty with which conclusions can be drawn. Missingness can be defined as both the existence of missing data and the mechanism that explains the reason for the data being missing. The extent to which missing values lead to biased conclusions about the magnitude of any treatment effect is influenced by many factors. Among these are the relationship between missingness, treatment assignment and outc ome; the type of measure employed to quantify the treatment effect and the expected changes over time for the variables being measured. It should be noted that the strategy employed to handle missing values might in itself constitute a source of bias and that there is no universal best approach for all situations. The acceptability of an approach will depend on the assumptions made and whether it is reasonable to make these assumptions in the particular case of interest. It is very important when designing a study that the likely pattern of missing data is taken into account when specifying the primary analysis and the predefined sensitivity analyses. The amount of missing data and the strategies selected to handle missing data can influence the required sample size, the estimate of treatment effect and the confidence with which data can ultimately be interpreted. As such, how to minimise the amount of missing data and how missing data are going to be handled in the analysis are critical issues that must be considered when planning a clinical trial. This document is not an extensive review of all the available methods, nor can it be a guide to preferred methods in any specific experimental situation. Instead general recommendations on acceptable frameworks for handling missing data in a regulatory setting are outlined. A positive regulatory decision should not be based on an analysis that is biased in favour of the experimental agent. Hence when proposing methods to handle missing data it is important that an analysis is provided for which it is judged that it is unlikely that it is biased in favour of the experimental treatment (i.e. the method can be considered ‘conservative’). 2.

The main focus of this guideline is issues associated with the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint where patients are followed up over time. Typically in such trials, some patients withdraw from the study or are lost to follow-up and hence data for those patients are missing from some point at or after a baseline assessment through to the end of the study. The principles outlined apply to superiority and non-inferiority trials as well as to equivalence trials, though the same biased estimate of the treatment effect may lead to different conclusions for trials with different objectives. 3. Legal basis The Guideline has to be read in conjunction with Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended, and all other relevant EU and ICH guidelines. These include, but are not limited to: CPMP/ICH/363/96, ICH Topic E9 Step 4 Note for Guidance on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials. 4. The Effect of Missing Values on Data Analysi s and Interpretation The following problems may affect the interpretation of the trial results when some missing data are present. 4/12 4.1. Power and Variability The sample size and the variability of the outcomes a ffect the power of a clinical trial. The power of a trial will increase if the sample size is increased or if the variability of the outcomes is reduced. If missing values are handled by simply excluding any patients with missing values from the analysis, this will result in a reduction in the number of cases available for analysis and therefore normally result in a reduction of the statistical power. Clearly, the greater the number of missing values, the greater the likely reduction in power. Hence every effort should be made to minimize the amount of missing data. Conversely, non-completers might be more likely to have extreme values (treatment failure leading to dropout, extremely good response leading to loss of follow-up). Therefor e, the loss of these non- completers could lead to an underestimate of variability and hence artificially narrow the confidence interval for the treatment effect. If the methods used to handle missing data do not adequately take this into account, the resulting confidence interval cannot be considered a valid summary of the uncertainty of the treatment effect. 4.2. Bias Bias is the most important concern resulting from missing data. If patients are excluded from the analysis, this may affect:  The comparability of the treatment groups. A consequence of this may be a bias in the estimation of the treatment effect.  The representativeness of the study sample in relation to the target population (external validity). While the reduction of the statistical power is mainly related to the number of missing values, the risk of bias in the estimation of the treatment effect fr om the observed data depends upon the relationship between missingness and treatment and outcome (see also Section 6.1):  In principle, missing values will not be expected to lead to bias if they are not related to the real value of the unobserved measurement (e.g. poor outcomes are no more likely to be missing than good outcomes).  Conversely, if the unmeasured observation is related to the real value of the outcome (e.g. the unobserved measurements have a higher proporti on of poor outcomes), this may lead to a biased estimate of the treatment effect even if the missing values are not related to treatment (i.e. missing values are equally likely in all treatment arms).  Ignoring missing observations will lead to bias if related to both the treatment and the unobserved outcome variable (e.g. missing values are more likely in one treatment arm because it is not as effective). It is not possible to establish the relationship between missingness and the unobserved outcome variable. Thus it is sensible to adopt a conservative approach, considering missing values as a potential source of bias. It should also be noted that the pa ttern and extent of missing data can itself provide important information for the interpretation of a trial. The type of bias that can critically affect interpre tation will depend upon whether the objective of the study is to show a difference or demonstrate non-in feriority/equivalence. If the variability of the treatment effect is underestimated, the width of the resulting confidence interval will be too narrow. In a superiority trial this could lead to a false claim of a statistically significant result. Similarly, in a non- inferiority/equivalence trial this could lead to a false claim of non-inferiority/equivalence. In a superiority or non-inferiority trial, an inflated estimate of the treatment effect is biased in favour of the experimental treatment. This too can lead to a false claim of superiority/non-inferiority being made. In an equivalence trial, an inflated estimate of difference between treatments is"}

In an equivalence trial, an inflated estimate of difference between treatments is potentially biased against the experimental treatment. This could lead to equivalence being incorrectly rejected in situations where effects of experimental and reference treatments are the same. 5. General Recommendations Unfortunately, there is no methodological approach for handling missing values that is universally accepted in all situations. Nevertheless there are some rules which should be considered when handling missing data. 5/12 5.1 Avoidance of Missing Data There is no rule regarding the maximum number of missing values that could be acceptable. The quantity of missing data may be affected by a number of factors: a) The nature of the outcome variable: the occurrence of missing values is expected to be lower when the outcome variable is mortality (e.g. in cardiovascular trials), than when the outcome is more difficult to assess and requires the active particip ation of patients and/or sophisticated methods of diagnosis. b) The length of the clinical trials: the longer the follow up the greater the likelihood of missing values. c) The therapeutic indication: missing values are more frequent in those diseases where the adherence of patients to the study protocol is usually low (e.g. psychiatric disorders). d) The treatment modalities: e.g. surgical versus medical treatment. Several major difficulties arise as a result of the presence of missing values and these are aggravated as the number of missing values increases. Thus, it is extremely important to avoid the presence of unobserved measurements as much as possible, by fa vouring designs that minimise this problem, as well as strengthening data collection regardless of the patient’s adherence to the protocol. Continued collection of data after the patient’s cessation of study treatment is strongly encouraged, in particular data on clinical outcome. In some circumstances, in particular where this type of “retrieved dropout” information represents the progression of the patient without (or before) impact of further therapeutic intervention, these data will give the best approximation to the Full Analysis Set and would generally be seen as a sound basis for the primary analysis. This analysis is especially important when the aim of the study is establish the efficacy of the test treatment over the whole study duration. Data should also be collected on other therapies received post dropout. Specifically full details of the type of additional (non-randomised) therapy given, including when an d for how long it was used and at what dose, should be collected. This information will allow the value of any outcome data collected after withdrawal to be put into context. 5.2 Design of the study and relevance of predefinition It is very important when designing the study and specifying the statistical methods to be used, to anticipate the proportion of missing values likely to be observed in the trial. Experience from exploratory trials and from other trials in related indications should inform expectations for missing data when planning the trial. Careful planning w ill help specify a plausible approach to handling missing data and also help to specify a range of sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of departures from the expected missing data pattern. As part of this process, an upfront investigation of different missing data handling methods under diffe rent assumptions, ranging from pessimistic to realistic to optimistic, using clinical scenario evaluations should be carried out. Indeed, an estimate of the predicted (and unavoidable) amount of missing data is highly recommended: firstly because this may have repercussions for the variability and the expectations of the effect size and hence the sample size calculation, secondly because proper planning should minimise the risk that the strategy for missing data handling itself introduces bias, and thirdly because the uncertainty introduced in interpreting the results increases (and hence the num ber of sensitivity analyses required may need to increase – See Section 7) as the number of missing values increases. There is no universally applicable method of addressing the fact that data for some patients are missing at specific timepoints, and different appr oaches may lead to different results. To avoid concerns over data-driven selection of methods, it is essential to pre-specify the selected methods in the statistical section of the study protocol or analysis plan and to pre-specify which method will be used for the primary analysis. This section must include a detailed description of the selected methods and a justification of why the methods to be app lied are expected to be an appropriate way of summarising the results of the study and allow a ssessment without an important degree of bias in favour of experimental treatment.

This section must include a detailed description of the selected methods and a justification of why the methods to be app lied are expected to be an appropriate way of summarising the results of the study and allow a ssessment without an important degree of bias in favour of experimental treatment. The sensitivity analyses envisaged should also be pre-specified. It is considered of particular importance to consider whether the selected method is likely to be a conservative approach (under circumstances expected to occur in the study), which is not expected to favour the study’s working (alternative) hypothesis (e.g. demonstration of superiority to placebo or demonstration of non-inferiority to active control) either because of a bias in the point estimate or because of an under-estimate of the variability. The process of imputation or modelling might be relevant to not only the main variables, but also to the baseline variables and covariates, and key secondary efficacy and safety variables with a view to including all patients in all important analyses. 6/12 5.3 Final Report A detailed description of the pre-planned methods used for handling missing data, any amendments of that plan and a justification for those amendments should be included in the clinical study report. If the pattern of missing data is different to that envisa ged at the design stage, and the planned sensitivity analyses are inadequate, further sensitivity analyses should be provided that are tailored to the missing data pattern observed (see section 7). To properly address the missing data problem it may be insufficient to only follow pre-specified methods, without consideration of the actual data collected. A critical discussion of the number, timing, pattern, reason for and possible implications of missing values in efficacy and safety assessments should be included in the clinical report as a matter of routine. Graphical summaries (e.g. Kaplan-Meier plots) of the dropout patterns should be provided so that it can be clearly seen if there is a differential dropout pattern between treatment groups. These graphical summaries should identify the recorded reason for dropout. Data explorations and accompanying explanations that investigate missing data imbalance in all relevant factors and whether patients with and without missing values have different characteristics at baseline can also be informative. Data presentations supporting the efficacy results should be such that it helps to quantify the contribution of each patient to the statistical analysis. For example, if single imputation methods are used (see section 6.3.1) th e imputed values must be listed and identified. Elucidation of the missing data pattern is just as important to regulatory assessment as the choice of missing data handling method as it helps to understand the likely direction of any bias in the analyses. When patients drop out of a trial, full reporting of all reasons for their discontinuation should be given where possible. This should allow identification of the most important reasons that caused them to discontinue and may influence how these subjects are treated in the missing data analysis. Any follow- up information collected post dropout could be helpful in justifying how these patients are handled in the analyses. The final report must include docume ntation of any deviation from the expected number of missing values, a discussion of whether the pre-defined analysis is still sensible, plus appropriate sensitivity analyses. As stated before, sensitivity analyses should investigate the robustness of the conclusions of the study, and it is essential that an analysis can be identified which is assessed not to be biased to an important degree in favour of experimental treatment. Also the confidence interval for this analysis should appropriately reflect the uncertainty associated with the estimated treatment effect. Because of the unpredictability of some problems, it may be acceptable to allow in the study protocol the possibility of updating the strategy for dealing with missing values in the statistical analysis plan at a later point in time (e.g. during the blind review of the data at the end of the trial). Relevant deviations from and amendments of the pre-specified plan should be clearly documented and justified. In addition, the time at which these deviations and amendments were decided and implemented in relation to the blinding of the data must be clearly identified. Methods for the documentation of these changes can be found in ICH E9. If unexpected missing data patterns are found in the data, it will be necessary to conduct some post hoc sensitivity analyses in addition to those predefined in the statistical analysis plan (see section 7). In this case the reasons why these analyses have been conducted should be carefully explained and thoroughly justified, and the initially planned analysis should also be presented. Proper pla nning will minimise the number of such post hoc analyses, avoiding concerns over data-driven selection of methods. As with any retrospective analysis, implementation will be closely scrutinised. It"}

They should only be used to investigate whether positive results remain so when the unexpected missing data pattern is appropriately reflected in the sensitivity analyses. 6. Handling of Missing Data 6.1 Theoretical Framework A framework in the literature for the applicability of the different methods to handle missingness is based on a classification according to the following missingness mechanisms:  For the dependent variable (conditional on the covariates in the model), if the probability of an observation being missing does not depend on observed or unobserved measurements then the observation is Missing Completely At Random (MCAR). A typical example is a patient moving to another city for non-health reasons. Patients who drop out of a study for this reason could be considered a random and representative sample from the total study population. 7/12  Conditional on the covariates in the model, if the probability of an observation being missing depends only on observed measurements then the observation is Missing At Random (MAR). This assumption implies that the behaviour of the post dropout observations can be predicted from the observed variables, and therefore that response can be estimated without bias using exclusively the observed data. For example, when a patient drops out due to lack of efficacy reflected by a series of poor efficacy outcomes that have been observed, it would be appropriate to impute or model poor efficacy outcomes subsequently for this patient.  When observations are neither MCAR nor MAR, they are classified as Missing Not At Random (MNAR), i.e. the probability of an observation being missing depends on unobserved measurements. In this scenario, the value of the unobserved responses depends on information not available for the analysis (i.e . not the values observ ed previously on the analysis variable or the covariates being used), and thus, future observations cannot be predicted without bias by the model. For example, it may happen that after a series of visits with good outcome, a patient drops out due to la ck of efficacy. In this situation the analysis model based on the observed data, including relevant covariates, is likely to continue to predict a good outcome, but it is usually unreasonable to expect the patient to continue to derive benefit from treatment. As already stated in section 4.2., it is impossible to be certain whether there is a relationship between missing values and the unobserved outcome variable, or to judge whether missing data can be adequately predicted from the observed data. It is not possible to know whether the MAR, never mind MCAR, assumptions are appropriate in any practical situation. A proposition that none of the data missing in a confirmatory clinical trial are MNAR seems implausible. Because it cannot be excluded that some data may be MNAR, the properties (e.g. bias) of any methods based on MCAR or MAR assumptions cannot be relia bly determined for any given dataset. Therefore the justifications for the methods chosen should not depend primarily on the properties of the methods under the MAR or MCAR assumptions but on whether it is considered to provide an estimate that is acceptable for regulatory decision making in the circumstances of the trial under consideration. 6.2 Complete Case Analysis Complete case analysis cannot be recommended as the primary analysis in a confirmatory trial. In this approach incomplete data are ignored and the statis tical analysis is performed using only cases with complete data. Some problems associated with this approach are discussed in section 4. In general, complete case analysis violates the intention to treat principle and is subject to bias. However, the approach may be considered in other circumstances, e.g.  In exploratory studies, especially in the initial phases of drug development.  In confirmatory trials as a secondary supportive analysis (sensitivity analysis) to illustrate the robustness of conclusions. 6.3 Methods of Handling Missing Data Factors that affect the acceptability of individual methods include:  differences between the treatment groups in the proportion of patient withdrawals,  differences between the treatment groups in the timing of withdrawals,  the reason for the patient withdrawals,  the direction of any spontaneous changes over time. All of these factors must be comprehensively displayed and their influence discussed when the methods used to handle missing data are justified. This highlights the importance of proper planning (see section 5.2) and proper evaluation of unanticipated occurrences (see section 5.3). The acceptability of any method will"}

All of these factors must be comprehensively displayed and their influence discussed when the methods used to handle missing data are justified. This highlights the importance of proper planning (see section 5.2) and proper evaluation of unanticipated occurrences (see section 5.3). The acceptability of any method will be judged by the same standards regardless of its complexity or its assumptions. As described in section 6.3.1 and 6.3. 2, a primary analysis can only be accepted if is considered that an important bias in favour of the experimental treatment can be reasonably excluded and if it can be verified that the associated confidence interval does not underestimate the variability of the estimated treatment effect to an important extent. In the event that the proportion of missing data is non-negligible, it is likely that no single method will provide a comprehensive solution to the missing data problem. 8/12 6.3.1 Imputation Methods Single imputation methods replace a missing data point by a single value and analyses are conducted as if all the data were observed. To cope with situations where data collection is in terrupted before the predetermined last evaluation timepoint, one widely used single imputation method is Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). This analysis imputes the last measured value of the endpoint to all subsequent, scheduled, but missing, evaluations. Only under certain restrictive assumptions does LO CF produce an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect. Moreover, in some situations, LOCF does no t produce conservative estimates. However, this approach can still provide a conservative estimate of the treatment effect in some circumstances. To give some particular examples, if the patient’s co ndition is expected to deteriorate over time (for example in Alzheimer’s disease) an LOCF analysis is very likely to give overly optimistic results for both treatment groups, and if the withdrawals on the active group are earlier (e.g. because of adverse events) the treatment comparison will clearly provide an inappropriate estimate of the treatment effect and may be biased in favour of the test product. Hence in this situation an LOCF analysis is not considered appropriate. Indeed in Alzheimer’s disease, and other indications for diseases that deteriorate over time, finding a method that gives an appropriate estimate of the treatment effect will usually be difficult and multiple sensitivity analyses will frequently be required. However, in other clinical situations (e.g. depression), where the condition is expected to improve spontaneously over time, LOCF (even though it has some sub-optimal statistical properties) might be conservative in the situations where patients in the experimental group tend to withdraw earlier and more frequently. Establishing a treatment effect based on a primary analysis which is clearly conservative represents compelling evidence of efficacy from a regulatory perspective. Baseline Observation Carried Forward (BOCF) is another single imputation approach that is sometimes used. The use of BOCF may be appropriate in, for ex ample, a chronic pain trial where when a patient withdraws from treatment it may be reasonable to assume that pain return to its baseline level and that the patient does not, in the long-term, derive benefit from treatment. Other simple approaches for single imputation of missing data are to replace the unobserved measurements by values derived from other sources. Possible sources include information from the same subject collected before withdrawal, from othe r subjects with similar baseline characteristics, a predicted value from an empirically developed mode l or historical data. Examples of empirically developed models are unconditional and conditional mean imputation, best or worst case imputation (assigning the worst possible value of the outcome to dropouts for a negative reason (treatment failure) and the best possible value to positive dropouts (cures)), regression methods and hot-deck imputation. These approaches may sometimes be useful as sensitivity analyses. An attractive approach for imputing missing data may be to employ a different pre-specified imputation technique for each different reason for withdrawal, rather than the same technique for all patients. While this would represent a relatively novel approach, there is no objection to this in principle. The strategy has more flexibility in hand ling different reasons for and timings of withdrawal and consequently the possible relationship between missing data and the outcome of interest. If used appropriately, it may better address the question of primary regulatory interest. The method also offers an intuitive framework for conducting a range of sensitivity analyses. A potential disadvantage of single imputation methods is that these methods risk biasing the standard error downwards by ignoring the uncertainty of impu ted values. Therefore, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect calculated using single imputation methods may be too narrow and give an artificial impression of precision that does not rea lly exist. This possibility should be addressed when results from these analyses are presented. The risk of underestimating the variance of treatment effect when imputing"}

Therefore, the confidence intervals for the treatment effect calculated using single imputation methods may be too narrow and give an artificial impression of precision that does not rea lly exist. This possibility should be addressed when results from these analyses are presented. The risk of underestimating the variance of treatment effect when imputing can be reduced by proper implementation of techniques such as multiple imputation. Multiple imputation methods generate multiple copies of the original dataset by replacing missing values using an appropriate stochastic model, analyse them as complete sets and finally combine the different parameter estimates across the datasets to produce a unique point estimate and standard error taking into account the uncertainty of the imputation process. The seed of the pseudorandom number generator used to randomly generate imputations for the missing values should be pre-specified in the protocol to avoid bias being introduced by post hoc selection of the seed and therefore the random numbers to be imputed. 9/12 6.3.2 Mixed models and generalised estimating equations Some statistical approaches to handling missing data do not employ explicit imputation. For continuous responses, linear mixed models are sometimes used to handle missingness when a series of outcomes are measured repeatedly over time (mixed-effect models for repeated measures (MMRM)). For categorical responses and count data, the so-called marginal (e.g. generalized estimating equations (GEE)) and random-effects (e.g. generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)) approaches are in use. Likelihood-based methods (MMRM and GLMM) and some extended GEE (i.e. weighted GEE) models are applicable under MCAR and MAR assumptions. In many cases, there is a variety of different settings for each method which could lead to different conclusions (e.g. type of variance-covariance matrix for MMRM and assumptions to model the unobserved measurements used in the MNAR methods, etc.). Therefore, the precise option settings must be fully justified and predefined in advance in detail, so that the results could be replicated, if required, by an external data analyst and so that it can be established that the choice has not been made post hoc. Under the MAR assumption, the methods above provid e an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect that would have been observed if all patients had continued on treatment for the full study duration. H o w e v e r , s i n c e i t i s l i k e l y t h a t s o m e d a t a a r e MNAR, these methods will, in certain circumstances, overestimate the size of the treatment effect likely to be seen in practice, and hence introduce bias in favour of the experimental treatment. In light of this, the point estimates obtained can be similar to those from a complete cases analysis, and therefore may introduce important bias. This is problematic in the context of a regulatory submission as confirmatory clinical trials should estimate the effect of the experimental intervention in the population of patients with greatest external validity, and not in the unrealistic scenario where all patients receive treatment with full compliance to the treatment schedule and with a complete follow-up as per protocol. It is not acceptable to make an assumption that data are MAR and therefore to present such models as a comprehensive solution to the missing data problem. Generally, MNAR data is difficult to rule out, and it is not clear whether even a small amount of MNAR data could have an impact on the study results in a particular experiment. Therefore, approaches that investigate different MNAR scenarios such as a pattern mixture model (PMM), a selection model (SEM) and a shared parameter model (SPM) may be usef ul. A combined strategy incorporating several methods for handling missingness (e.g. assume dropouts due to lack of efficacy and adverse events are MNAR and lost to follow-up are MAR) may also be considered. As described above, methods that do not assume MCAR or MAR such as PMMs may offer a flexible framework to explore the impact of treating different types of missing data as MNAR and evaluating the impact different modelling strategies have on the estimated treatment effect. 6.4 Responder Analysis In some circumstances, the primary analysis of a continuous variable is supported by a responder analysis.

In a situation where responder analysis is not foreseen as the primary analysis, but where the proportion of missing data may be so substantial that no imputation or modelling strategies can be considered reliable, a responder analysis (patients with missing data due to patient withdrawal treated as failures) may represent the most meaningful way of investigating whether there is sufficient evidence of the existence of a treatment effect. 6.5 Survival Analysis When the outcome measure is time to event, surv ival models which take into account censored observations are often used. Specialist consideratio ns are outside the scope of the current document. However, some standard survival methods assume th at there is no relationship between the response and the missing outcome. Violations from this assumption could lead to biased results especially when data are missing due to withdrawal (rather than data for an interim visit being missing). Therefore whether it is reasonable to assume non-informative censoring should be discussed in the protocol or the study report. This is particularly of importance in situations where the amount of missing 10/12 data/patient withdrawals could influence whether the treatment effect is established or could influence the size of the treatment effect. A range of se nsitivity analyses should be provided. Further considerations for handling this type of data are outlined in Appendix 1 to the CHMP guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medicinal products in man (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/27994/2008). 6.6 Count Data For count data (e.g. the number of exacerbations) a weighted approach with time-in-study as an offset variable (e.g. Poisson regression) is sometimes used. Although this approach is intuitively appealing it should be noted that it assumes there is no re lationship between the response and the missing outcome i.e., the method assumes that event rate after withdrawal from trial is the same as event rate on study treatment. For this reason it will often not be an appropriate primary analysis of count data in the presence of missing data. It is recommended that data are collected after withdrawal from study treatment as outlined in section 5.1 and a primary analysis that takes into account post withdrawal information is adopted. Baseline count imputation could also be a plausible approach if information after withdrawal from study treatment is not available. 7. Sensitivity Analyses In this context, sensitivity analyses can be defined as a set of analyses where the missing data are handled in a different way as compared to the primary analysis. It should be noted that obtaining similar results from a range of methods that make similar or the same assumptions does not constitute an adequate set of sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analyses should show how different assumptions influence the results obtained. In submissions with non-negligible amounts of missing data, sensitivity analyses should be presented as support to the main analysis. Because the performance of any analysis presented (in terms of bias and precision) cannot be fully elucidated, presentation of trial results without adequate investigation of the assumptions made for handling missing data cannot be considered comprehensive. When the results of the sensitivity analyses are consistent with the primary analysis and lead to reasonably similar estimates of the treatment effect, this provides some assurance that neither the lost information nor the methods used to handle missing data had an important effect on the overall study conclusions. In this situation the robustness of the results is clear and the missing values will not generally be considered to be a serious source of concern. The consistency of results from a broader range of sensitivity analyses will give greater reassurance on the robustness of the trial results. Conversely, for a study with a statistically significant primary analysis, whilst not all sensitivity analyses must necessarily give statistically significan t results, if they produce inconsistent results (e.g. a markedly smaller estimate of treatment effect), their repercussions on the conclusions of the trial must be discussed. In certain circumstances, the infl uence of missing data is so great that it might not be possible to reliably interpret the results from the trial. The sensitivity analyses required will need to be defined on a case-by-case basis, though they will usually comprise the analyses already described in Section 6 above. Some ways of performing a sensitivity analysis are:  Compare the results of the full set analysis to those of the complete case analysis.  As discussed in section 6.2, it is not possible to guarantee that at least some of the missing data are not MNAR. Therefore, when missing data are particularly problematic, further sensitivity analyses that treat certain types of missing data as MNAR should be provided. It may be appropriate to treat data missing for different reasons in different ways. A range of analyses"}

For each of these analyses, a clear explanation of what values have been imputed should be given. This may be done using multiple imputation methods incorporating pattern mixture approaches.  Compare the impact different model settings have on the results. If different results are obtained from models using the same missing mechanism assumption (e.g. multiple imputation versus MMRM both assuming MAR) full details of the differences between these models that explain the different results obtained should be provided. In any case the impact different settings of a model have on the results obtained should be explained in detail.  Utilise retrieved dropout data if not already done for the primary analysis. If a patient has received other therapies after withdrawing from the study, a positive value for the primary endpoint at the end of the trial could be due, in part at least, to the switching of therapies for 11/12 12/12 this patient. Analyses that downplay the positive outcome to give a more realistic view of the product being evaluated should be conducted.  A primary analysis of a continuous variable could be supported by a responder analysis that treats all missing values as failures, or treats only missing values due to a certain reason (e.g. due to adverse events) as failures.  A worst case analysis: assigning the best possible outcome to missing values in the control group and the worst possible outcome to those of the experimental group. If this extreme analysis is still favourable then it can be confidently concluded that the results are robust to the handling of missing data. Each sensitivity analysis should be designed to assess the effect on the results of the particular assumptions made to account for the missing data. The sensitivity analysis should be planned and described in the protocol and/or in the statistical analysis plan and any changes must be documented and justified in the study report.

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and Purpose The efficacy and safety of medicinal products should be demonstrated by clinical trials which follow the guidance in 'Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline' (ICH E6) adopted by the ICH, 1 May 1996. The role of statistics in clinical trial design and analysis is acknowledged as essential in that ICH guideline. The proliferation of statistical research in the area of clinical trials coupled with the critical role of clinical research in the drug approval process and health care in general necessitate a succinct document on statistical issues rela ted to clinical trials. This guidance is written primarily to attempt to harmonise the principles of statistical methodology applied to clinical trials for marketing a pplications submitted in Europe, Japan and the United States. As a starting point, this guideline ut ilised the CPMP (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products) Note for Guidance entitled 'Biostatistical Methodology in Clinical Trials in Applications for Marketing Authorisations for Medicinal Products' (December, 1994). It was also influenced by 'Guidelines on the Statistical Analysis of Clinical Studies' (March, 1992) from the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration document entitled 'Guideline for the Format and Content of the Clinical and Statistical Sections of a New Drug Application' (July, 1988). Some topics related to statistica l principles and methodology are also embedded within other ICH guidelines, parti cularly those listed below.

The do cument will also assist scientific experts charged with preparing application summaries or assessing evidence of efficacy and safety, principally from clinical trials in later phases of development. 1.2 Scope and Direction The focus of this guidance is on statistical principles. It does not address the use of specific statistical procedures or methods. Specific proced ural steps to ensure that principles are implemented properly are the responsibility of the sponsor. Integration of data across clinical trials is discussed, but is not a primary focus of this guidance. Selected principles and procedures relate d to data management or clinical trial monitoring activities are covered in other ICH guidelines and are not addressed here. This guidance should be of interest to in dividuals from a broad range of scientific disciplines. However, it is assumed that th e actual responsibility for all statistical work associated with clinical trials w ill lie with an appropriately qualified and experienced statistician, as indicated in ICH E6. The role and responsibility of the trial statistician (see Glossary), in collaborati on with other clinical trial professionals, is to ensure that statistical principles are applied appropriately in clinical trials supporting drug development. Thus, the tri al statistician should have a combination of education/training and experience sufficient to implement the principles articulated in this guidance. For each clinical trial contributing to a mark eting application, all important details of its design and conduct and the principal feat ures of its proposed statistical analysis should be clearly specified in a protocol wr itten before the trial begins. The extent to which the procedures in the protocol are followed and the primary analysis is planned a priori will contribute to the degree of confidence in the final results and conclusions of the trial. The protocol and subsequent amendments should be approved by the responsible personnel, including the trial statistician. The trial statistician should ensure that the protocol and any amendmen ts cover all relevant statistical issues clearly and accurately, using technical terminology as appropriate. The principles outlined in this guidance are primarily relevant to clinical trials conducted in the later phases of developmen t, many of which are confirmatory trials of efficacy. In addition to efficacy, co nfirmatory trials may have as their primary variable a safety variable (e.g. an adverse ev ent, a clinical laboratory variable or an electrocardiographic measure), a pharmacodynamic or a pharmacokinetic variable (as in a confirmatory bioequivalence trial). Fu rthermore, some confirmatory findings may be derived from data integrated across trial s, and selected principles in this guidance are applicable in this situation. Finally, although the early phases of drug development consist mainly of clinical trials that are exploratory in nature, statistical principles are also relevant to these clin ical trials. Hence, the substance of this document should be applied as far as possible to all phases of clinical development. Many of the principles delineated in this guidance deal with minimising bias (see Glossary) and maximising precision. As used in this guidance, the term 'bias' describes the systematic tendency of any fa ctors associated with the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of the results of clinical trials to make the estimate of a treatment effect (see Glossary) deviate from its true value. It is important to identify potential sources of bias as completely as possible so that attempts to limit such bias may be made. The presence of bias may seriously compromise the ability to draw valid conclusions from clinical trials. 2 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Some sources of bias arise from the design of the trial, for example an assignment of treatments such that subjects at lower ri sk are systematically assigned to one treatment. Other sources of bias arise duri ng the conduct and analysis of a clinical trial. For example, protocol violations and exclusion of subjects from analysis based upon knowledge of subject outcomes are possible sources of bias that may affect the accurate assessment of the treatment effect. Because bias can occur in subtle or unknown ways and its effect is not measurable directly, it is important to evaluate the robustness of the results and primary conclu sions of the trial. Robustness is a concept that refers to the sensitivity of the"}

For example, protocol violations and exclusion of subjects from analysis based upon knowledge of subject outcomes are possible sources of bias that may affect the accurate assessment of the treatment effect. Because bias can occur in subtle or unknown ways and its effect is not measurable directly, it is important to evaluate the robustness of the results and primary conclu sions of the trial. Robustness is a concept that refers to the sensitivity of the overa ll conclusions to various limitations of the data, assumptions, and analytic approaches to data analysis. Robustness implies that the treatment effect and primary conclusions of the trial are not substantially affected when analyses are carried out based on alternative assumptions or analytic approaches. The interpretation of statistical measures of uncertainty of the treatment effect and treatment comparisons should involve consideration of the potential contribution of bias to the p-value, confidence interval, or inference. Because the predominant approaches to the design and analysis of clinical trials have been based on frequentist statistical methods, the guidance largely refers to the use of frequentist methods (see Glossary) when discussing hypothesis testing and/or confidence intervals. This should not be ta ken to imply that other approaches are not appropriate: the use of Bayesian (see Glossary) and other approaches may be considered when the reasons for their use are clear and when the resulting conclusions are sufficiently robust. II. CONSIDERATIONS FOR OVERALL CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 2.1 Trial Context 2.1.1 Development Plan The broad aim of the process of clinical development of a new drug is to find out whether there is a dose range and schedule at which the drug can be shown to be simultaneously safe and effective, to the exte nt that the risk-benefit relationship is acceptable. The particular subjects who may benefit from the drug, and the specific indications for its use, also need to be defined. Satisfying these broad aims usually requires an ordered programme of clinical trials, each with its own specific objectives (see ICH E8). This should be specified in a clinical plan, or a series of plans, with ap propriate decision points and flexibility to allow modification as knowledge accumulate s. A marketing application should clearly describe the main content of such plans, and the contribution made by each trial. Interpretation and assessment of the evidence from the total programme of trials involves synthesis of the evidence from the individual trials (see Section 7.2). This is facilitated by ensuring that common standards are adopted for a number of features of the trials such as dictionaries of medical terms, definition and timing of the main measurements, handling of protocol deviations and so on. A statistical summary, overview or meta-analysis (see Glossary) ma y be informative when medical questions are addressed in more than one trial. Where possible this should be envisaged in the plan so that the relevant trials are clea rly identified and any necessary common features of their designs are specified in advance. Other major statistical issues (if any) that are expected to affect a number of trials in a common plan should be addressed in that plan. 3 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials 2.1.2 Confirmatory Trial A confirmatory trial is an adequately con trolled trial in which the hypotheses are stated in advance and evaluated. As a ru le, confirmatory trials are necessary to provide firm evidence of efficacy or safety. In such trials the key hypothesis of interest follows directly from the trial’s primary obje ctive, is always pre-defined, and is the hypothesis that is subsequently tested when the trial is complete. In a confirmatory trial it is equally important to estimate with due precision the size of the effects attributable to the treatment of interest and to relate these effects to their clinical significance. Confirmatory trials are intended to provide firm evidence in support of claims and hence adherence to protocols and standar d operating procedures is particularly important; unavoidable changes should be explained and documented, and their effect examined. A justification of the design of each such trial, and of other important statistical aspects such as the principal features of the planned analysis, should be set out in the protocol. Each trial should address only a limited number of questions. Firm evidence in support of claims requires that the results of the confirmatory trials demonstrate that the investigational produ ct under test has clinical benefits. The confirmatory trials should therefore be suffi cient to answer each key clinical question relevant to the efficacy or safety claim cl early and definitively. In addition, it is important that the basis for generalisatio n (see Glossary) to the intended patient population is understood and explained; this may also influence the number and type (e.g. specialist or general practitioner) of centres and/or trials needed. The results of the confirmatory trial(s) should be robus t. In some circumstances the weight of evidence from a single confirmatory trial may be sufficient. 2.1.3 Exploratory Trial The rationale and design of"}

In addition, it is important that the basis for generalisatio n (see Glossary) to the intended patient population is understood and explained; this may also influence the number and type (e.g. specialist or general practitioner) of centres and/or trials needed. The results of the confirmatory trial(s) should be robus t. In some circumstances the weight of evidence from a single confirmatory trial may be sufficient. 2.1.3 Exploratory Trial The rationale and design of confirmatory trial s nearly always rests on earlier clinical work carried out in a series of exploratory studies. Like all clinical trials, these exploratory studies should have clear and precise objectives. However, in contrast to confirmatory trials, their objectives may not al ways lead to simple tests of pre-defined hypotheses. In addition, exploratory trial s may sometimes require a more flexible approach to design so that changes can be made in response to accumulating results. Their analysis may entail data exploration; tests of hypothesis may be carried out, but the choice of hypothesis may be data depend ent. Such trials cannot be the basis of the formal proof of efficacy, although they ma y contribute to the total body of relevant evidence. Any individual trial may have both conf irmatory and exploratory aspects. For example, in most confirmatory trials the data are also subjected to exploratory analyses which serve as a basis for explaini ng or supporting their findings and for suggesting further hypotheses for later rese arch. The protocol should make a clear distinction between the aspects of a trial which will be used for confirmatory proof and the aspects which will provide data for exploratory analysis. 2.2 Scope of Trials 2.2.1 Population In the earlier phases of drug development the choice of subjects for a clinical trial may be heavily influenced by the wish to maximi se the chance of observing specific clinical effects of interest, and hence they may come from a very narrow subgroup of the total patient population for which the drug may eventually be indicated. However by the time the confirmatory trials are undertaken, the subjects in the trials should more closely mirror the target population. Hence, in these trials it is generally helpful to 4 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials relax the inclusion and exclusion criteria as much as possible within the target population, while maintaining sufficient homo geneity to permit precise estimation of treatment effects. No individual clinical trial can be expected to be totally representative of future users, because of the possible influences of geographical location, the time when it is conducted, the medical practices of the particular investigator(s) and clinics, and so on. However the influence of such factors should be reduced wherever possible, and subsequently discussed during the interpretation of the trial results. 2.2.2 Primary and Secondary Variables The primary variable (‘target’ variable, primary endpoint) should be the variable capable of providing the most clinically relevant and convincing evidence directly related to the primary objective of the trial. There should generally be only one primary variable. This will usually be an efficacy variable, because the primary objective of most confirmatory trials is to provide strong scientific evidence regarding efficacy. Safety/tolerability may sometimes be the primary variable, and will always be an important consideration. Measurements relating to quality of life and health economics are further potential primary variables. The selection of the primary variable should reflect the accepted norms and standards in the relevant field of research. The use of a reliable and validated variable with which experience has been gained either in earlier studies or in published literature is recommended. There should be sufficient evidence that the primary variable can provide a valid and reliable measure of some clinically relev ant and important treatment benefit in the patient population described by the incl usion and exclusion criteria. The primary variable should generally be the one used when estimating the sample size (see section 3.5). In many cases, the approach to assessing subject outcome may not be straightforward and should be carefully defined. For example, it is inadequate to specify mortality as a primary variable without further clarif ication; mortality may be assessed by comparing proportions alive at fixed poin ts in time, or by comparing overall distributions of survival times over a specified interval.

There are many possible approaches, such as comparisons of the assessments done at the beginning and end of the interval of observation, comparisons of slopes calculated from all assessments throughout the interval, comparisons of the proportions of subjects exceeding or declining beyond a specified threshold, or comparisons based on methods for repeated measures data. To avoid multiplicity concerns arising from post ho c definitions, it is critical to specify in the protocol the precise definition of the primary variable as it will be used in the statistical analysis. In addition, the clinical relevance of the specific primary variable selected and the validity of the associated measurement procedures will generally need to be addressed and justified in the protocol. The primary variable should be specified in the protocol, along with the rationale for its selection. Redefinition of the primary variable after unblinding will almost always be unacceptable, since the biases this introduces are difficult to assess. When the clinical effect defined by the primary objecti ve is to be measured in more than one way, the protocol should identify one of the measurements as the primary variable on the basis of clinical relevance, import ance, objectivity, and/or other relevant characteristics, whenever such selection is feasible. 5 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Secondary variables are either supportive measurements related to the primary objective or measurements of effects rela ted to the secondary objectives. Their pre- definition in the protocol is also important , as well as an explanation of their relative importance and roles in interpretation of trial results. The number of secondary variables should be limited and should be related to the limited number of questions to be answered in the trial. 2.2.3 Composite Variables If a single primary variable cannot be selected from multiple measurements associated with the primary objective, anoth er useful strategy is to integrate or combine the multiple measurements into a si ngle or 'composite' variable, using a pre- defined algorithm. Indeed, the primary vari able sometimes arises as a combination of multiple clinical measurements (e.g. the rati ng scales used in arthritis, psychiatric disorders and elsewhere). This approach addresses the multiplicity problem without requiring adjustment to the type I error. The method of combining the multiple measurements should be specified in the protocol, and an interpretation of the resulting scale should be provided in terms of the size of a clinically relevant benefit. When a composite variable is used as a primary variable, the components of this variable may sometimes be analysed separately, where clinically meaningful and validated. When a rating scale is used as a primary variable, it is especially important to address such factors as content validit y (see Glossary), inter- and intra-rater reliability (see Glossary) and responsiveness fo r detecting changes in the severity of disease. 2.2.4 Global Assessment Variables In some cases, 'global assessment' variables (see Glossary) are developed to measure the overall safety, overall efficacy, and/or ov erall usefulness of a treatment. This type of variable integrates objective variables and the investigator’s overall impression about the state or change in the state of the subject, and is usually a scale of ordered categorical ratings. Global assessments of overall efficacy are well established in some therapeutic areas, such as neurology and psychiatry. Global assessment variables generally have a subjective component. When a global assessment variable is used as a primary or secondary variable, fuller details of the scale should be included in the protocol with respect to: 1) the relevance of the scale to the primary objective of the trial; 2) the basis for the validity and reliability of the scale; 3) how to utilise the data collected on an in dividual subject to assign him/her to a unique category of the scale; 4) how to assign subjects with missing da ta to a unique category of the scale, or otherwise evaluate them. If objective variables are considered by the investigator when making a global assessment, then those objective variables should be considered as additional primary, or at least important secondary, variables. Global assessment of usefulness integrates components of both benefit and risk and reflects the decision making process of the treating physician, who must weigh benefit and risk in making product use decisions. A problem with global usefulness variables is that their use could in some cases lead to the result of two products being declared equivalent despite having very different prof iles of beneficial and adverse effects. For example, judging the global usefulness of a treatment as equivalent or superior to an 6 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials alternative may mask the fact that it has little or no efficacy but fewer adverse effects. Therefore it is not advisable to use a global usefulness variable as a primary variable. If global usefulness is specified as primary, it is important to consider"}

Therefore it is not advisable to use a global usefulness variable as a primary variable. If global usefulness is specified as primary, it is important to consider specific efficacy and safety outcomes separately as additional primary variables. 2.2.5 Multiple Primary Variables It may sometimes be desirable to use more than one primary variable, each of which (or a subset of which) could be sufficient to cover the range of effects of the therapies. The planned manner of interpretation of this type of evidence should be carefully spelled out. It should be clear whether an impact on any of the variables, some minimum number of them, or all of them, would be considered necessary to achieve the trial objectives. The primary hypothesis or hypotheses and parameters of interest (e.g. mean, percentage, distribution) should be clearly stated with respect to the primary variables identified, and the approach to statistical inference described. The effect on the type I error should be explained because of the potential for multiplicity problems (see Section 5.6); the method of co ntrolling type I error should be given in the protocol. The extent of intercorrelation among the proposed primary variables may be considered in evaluating the impact on type I error. If the purpose of the trial is to demonstrate effects on all of the desi gnated primary variables, then there is no need for adjustment of the type I error, but the impact on type II error and sample size should be carefully considered. 2.2.6 Surrogate Variables When direct assessment of the clinical benefi t to the subject through observing actual clinical efficacy is not practical, indirect criteria (surrogate variables - see Glossary) may be considered. Commonly accepted surro gate variables are used in a number of indications where they are believed to be reli able predictors of clinical benefit. There are two principal concerns with the introdu ction of any proposed surrogate variable. First, it may not be a true predictor of the clinical outcome of interest. For example it may measure treatment activity associat ed with one specific pharmacological mechanism, but may not provide full information on the range of actions and ultimate effects of the treatment, whether positi ve or negative. There have been many instances where treatments showing a highly positive effect on a proposed surrogate have ultimately been shown to be detrime ntal to the subjects' clinical outcome; conversely, there are cases of treatment s conferring clinical benefit without measurable impact on proposed surrogates. Secondly, proposed surrogate variables may not yield a quantitative measure of clinic al benefit that can be weighed directly against adverse effects. Statistical criteria for validating surrogate variables have been proposed but the experience with their use is relatively limited. In practice, the strength of the evidence for surrogacy depe nds upon (i) the biological plausibility of the relationship, (ii) the demonstration in epidemiological studies of the prognostic value of the surrogate for the clinical outcome and (iii) evidence from clinical trials that treatment effects on the surrogate corre spond to effects on the clinical outcome. Relationships between clinical and surro gate variables for one product do not necessarily apply to a product with a differe nt mode of action for treating the same disease. 2.2.7 Categorised Variables Dichotomisation or other categorisation of continuous or ordinal variables may sometimes be desirable. Criteria of 'success' and 'response' are common examples of dichotomies which require precise specificat ion in terms of, for example, a minimum percentage improvement (relative to baseline) in a continuous variable, or a ranking categorised as at or above some threshold le vel (e.g., 'good') on an ordinal rating scale. 7 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials The reduction of diastolic blood pressure below 90mmHg is a common dichotomisation. Categorisations are most useful when they have clear clinical relevance. The criteria for categorisation sh ould be pre-defined and specified in the protocol, as knowledge of trial results could easily bias the choice of such criteria. Because categorisation normally implies a lo ss of information, a consequence will be a loss of power in the analysis; this should be accounted for in the sample size calculation. 2.3 Design Techniques to Avoid Bias The most important design techniques for avoiding bias in clinical trials are blinding and randomisation, and these should be norm al features of most controlled clinical trials intended to be included in a market ing application. Most such trials follow a double-blind approach in which treatments are pre-packed in accordance with a suitable randomisation schedule, and supplied to the trial centre(s) labelled only with the subject number and the treatment period so that no one involved in the conduct of the trial is aware"}

Most such trials follow a double-blind approach in which treatments are pre-packed in accordance with a suitable randomisation schedule, and supplied to the trial centre(s) labelled only with the subject number and the treatment period so that no one involved in the conduct of the trial is aware of the specific treatment allocated to any particular subject, not even as a code letter. This approach will be assumed in Section 2.3.1 and most of Section 2.3.2, exceptions being considered at the end. Bias can also be reduced at the design stag e by specifying proced ures in the protocol aimed at minimising any anticipated irregula rities in trial conduct that might impair a satisfactory analysis, including various types of protocol violations, withdrawals and missing values. The protocol should consider ways both to reduce the frequency of such problems, and also to handle the problems that do occur in the analysis of data. 2.3.1 Blinding Blinding or masking is intended to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of a clinical trial arising from the influence which the knowledge of treatment may have on the recruitment and allocation of subjects, their subsequent care, the attitudes of subjects to the treatments, the assessment of end-points, the handling of withdrawals, the exclusion of data from analysis, and so on. The essential aim is to prevent identification of the treatments until all such opportunities for bias have passed. A double-blind trial is one in which neither the subject nor any of the investigator or sponsor staff who are involved in the treatme nt or clinical evaluation of the subjects are aware of the treatment received. Th is includes anyone determining subject eligibility, evaluating endpoints, or assessing compliance with the protocol. This level of blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only when the data are cleaned to an acceptable level of qualit y will appropriate personnel be unblinded. If any of the sponsor staff who are not involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the subjects are required to be unblinded to the treatment code (e.g. bioanalytical scientists, auditors, those involved in se rious adverse event reporting), the sponsor should have adequate standard operating proc edures to guard against inappropriate dissemination of treatment codes. In a sing le-blind trial the investigator and/or his staff are aware of the treatment but the subje ct is not, or vice versa. In an open-label trial the identity of treatment is known to all. The double-blind trial is the optimal approach. This requires that the treatments to be applied during the trial cannot be distinguished (appearance, taste, etc.) eith er before or during administration, and that the blind is maintained appropriately during the whole trial. Difficulties in achieving the double-blind ideal can arise: the treatments may be of a completely different nature, for example, surgery and drug therapy; two drugs may have different formulations and, although they could be made indistinguishable by the use of capsules, changing the formulat ion might also change the pharmacokinetic 8 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials and/or pharmacodynamic properties and he nce require that bioequivalence of the formulations be established; the daily pa ttern of administration of two treatments may differ. One way of achieving double-blind conditions under these circumstances is to use a 'double-dummy' (see Glossary) technique. This technique may sometimes force an administration scheme that is su fficiently unusual to influence adversely the motivation and compliance of the subjects. Et hical difficulties may also interfere with its use when, for example, it entails du mmy operative procedures. Nevertheless, extensive efforts should be made to overcome these difficulties. The double-blind nature of some clinical trials may be partially compromised by apparent treatment induced effects. In such cases, blinding may be improved by blinding investigators and relevant sponsor staff to certain test results (e.g. selected clinical laboratory measures). Similar approaches (see below) to minimising bias in open-label trials should be considered in trials where unique or specific treatment effects may lead to unblinding individual patients. If a double-blind trial is not feasible, then the single-blind option should be considered. In some cases only an open-label trial is practically or ethically possible. Single-blind and open-label trials provide addi tional flexibility, but it is particularly important that the investigator's knowle dge of the next treatment should not influence the decision to enter the subject; this decision should precede knowledge of the randomised treatment. For these trials, consideration should be given to the use of a centralised randomisation method, such as telephone randomisation, to administer the assignment of randomised treatment. In addition, clinical assessments should be made by medical staff who are not involved in treating the subjects and who remain blind to treatment. In single-blind or open-label trials every effort should be made"}

In addition, clinical assessments should be made by medical staff who are not involved in treating the subjects and who remain blind to treatment. In single-blind or open-label trials every effort should be made to minimise the various known sources of bias and primary variables should be as objective as possible. The reasons for the degree of blinding adopted should be explained in the protocol, together with st eps taken to minimise bias by other means. For example, the sponsor should have ad equate standard operating procedures to ensure that access to the treatment code is appropriately restricted during the process of cleaning the database prior to its release for analysis. Breaking the blind (for a single subject) shou ld be considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment is deemed esse ntial by the subject’s physician for the subject’s care. Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind should be reported and explained at the end of the tri al, irrespective of the reason for its occurrence. The procedure and timing for revealing the treatment assignments should be documented. In this document, the blind review (see Glossary) of data refers to the checking of data during the period of time between trial comp letion (the last observation on the last subject) and the breaking of the blind. 2.3.2 Randomisation Randomisation introduces a deliberate element of chance into the assignment of treatments to subjects in a clinical trial. Du ring subsequent analysis of the trial data, it provides a sound statistical basis for the quantitative evaluation of the evidence relating to treatment effects. It also tend s to produce treatment groups in which the distributions of prognostic factors, known and unknown, are similar. In combination with blinding, randomisation helps to avoid possible bias in the selection and allocation of subjects arising from the predictability of treatment assignments. The randomisation schedule of a clinical trial documents the random allocation of treatments to subjects. In the simplest sit uation it is a sequential list of treatments (or treatment sequences in a crossover tri al) or corresponding codes by subject 9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials number. The logistics of some trials, such as those with a screening phase, may make matters more complicated, but the unique pre-planned assignment of treatment, or treatment sequence, to subject should be clear. Different trial designs will require different procedures for generating rand omisation schedules. The randomisation schedule should be reproducible (if the need arises). Although unrestricted randomisation is an acceptable approach, some advantages can generally be gained by randomising subjects in blocks. This helps to increase the comparability of the treatment groups, parti cularly when subject characteristics may change over time, as a result, for example, of changes in recruitment policy. It also provides a better guarantee that the treatment groups will be of nearly equal size. In crossover trials it provides the means of ob taining balanced designs with their greater efficiency and easier interpretation. Care should be taken to choose block lengths that are sufficiently short to limit possible imbal ance, but that are long enough to avoid predictability towards the end of the seque nce in a block. Investigators and other relevant staff should generally be blind to the block length; the use of two or more block lengths, randomly selected for each block, can achieve the same purpose. (Theoretically, in a double-blind trial predictability does not matter, but the pharmacological effects of drugs may provide the opportunity for intelligent guesswork.) In multicentre trials (see Glossary) the randomisation procedures should be organised centrally. It is advisable to have a separate random scheme for each centre, i.e. to stratify by centre or to allocate several whole blocks to each centre. More generally, stratification by important prognostic facto rs measured at baseline (e.g. severity of disease, age, sex, etc.) may sometimes be valuable in order to promote balanced allocation within strata; this has greater po tential benefit in small trials. The use of more than two or three stratification factors is rarely necessary, is less successful at achieving balance and is logistically troubl esome. The use of a dynamic allocation procedure (see below) may help to achieve balance across a number of stratification factors simultaneously provided the rest of the trial procedures can be adjusted to accommodate an approach of this type. Factors on which randomisation has been stratified should be accounted for later in the analysis. The next subject to be randomised into a trial should always receive the treatment corresponding to the next free number in th e appropriate randomisation schedule (in the respective stratum, if randomisation is stratified).

Details of the randomisation that facilitate predictability (e.g. block length) should not be contained in the trial protocol. The randomisation schedu le itself should be filed securely by the sponsor or an independent party in a manner that ensures that blindness is properly maintained throughout the trial. Access to the randomisation schedule during the trial should take into account the possibility that, in an emergency, the blind may have to be broken for any subject. The procedure to be followed, the necessary documentation, and the subsequent treatment and assessment of the subject should all be described in the protocol. Dynamic allocation is an alternative procedur e in which the allocation of treatment to a subject is influenced by the current balance of allocated treatments and, in a stratified trial, by the stratum to which the subject belongs and the balance within that stratum. Deterministic dynamic alloca tion procedures should be avoided and an appropriate element of randomisation shou ld be incorporated for each treatment allocation. Every effort should be made to retain the double-blind status of the trial. For example, knowledge of the treatment co de may be restricted to a central trial office from where the dynamic allocation is controlled, generally through telephone 10 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials contact. This in turn permits additional checks of eligibility criteria and establishes entry into the trial, features that can be valuable in certain types of multicentre trial. The usual system of pre-packing and labelling drug supplies for double-blind trials can then be followed, but the order of their use is no longer sequential. It is desirable to use appropriate computer algorithms to k eep personnel at the central trial office blind to the treatment code. The complexity of the logistics and potential impact on the analysis should be carefully evaluated when considering dynamic allocation. III. TRIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 3.1 Design Configuration 3.1.1 Parallel Group Design The most common clinical trial design for confirmatory trials is the parallel group design in which subjects are randomised to one of two or more arms, each arm being allocated a different treatment. These tre atments will include the investigational product at one or more doses, and one or more control treatments, such as placebo and/or an active comparator. The assumptions underlying this design are less complex than for most other designs. However, as wi th other designs, there may be additional features of the trial that complicate the anal ysis and interpretation (e.g. covariates, repeated measurements over time, intera ctions between design factors, protocol violations, dropouts (see Glossary) and withdrawals). 3.1.2 Crossover Design In the crossover design, each subject is r andomised to a sequence of two or more treatments, and hence acts as his own contro l for treatment comparisons. This simple manoeuvre is attractive primarily because it reduces the number of subjects and usually the number of assessments needed to achieve a specific power, sometimes to a marked extent. In the simplest 2×2 crossover design each subject receives each of two treatments in randomised order in two succe ssive treatment periods, often separated by a washout period. The most common extension of this entails comparing n(>2) treatments in n periods, each subject receiv ing all n treatments. Numerous variations exist, such as designs in which each subje ct receives a subset of n(>2) treatments, or ones in which treatments are repeated within a subject. Crossover designs have a number of problems that can invalidate their results. The chief difficulty concerns carryover, that is , the residual influence of treatments in subsequent treatment periods. In an addi tive model the effect of unequal carryover will be to bias direct treatment comparison s. In the 2×2 design the carryover effect cannot be statistically distinguished from the interaction between treatment and period and the test for either of these e ffects lacks power because the corresponding contrast is 'between subject'. This problem is less acute in higher order designs, but cannot be entirely dismissed. When the crossover design is used it is ther efore important to avoid carryover. This is best done by selective and careful use of the design on the basis of adequate knowledge of both the disease area and the new medication. The disease under study should be chronic and stable. The relevant effects of the medication should develop fully within the treatment period. The washou t periods should be sufficiently long for complete reversibility of drug effect. The fact"}

This is best done by selective and careful use of the design on the basis of adequate knowledge of both the disease area and the new medication. The disease under study should be chronic and stable. The relevant effects of the medication should develop fully within the treatment period. The washou t periods should be sufficiently long for complete reversibility of drug effect. The fact that these conditions are likely to be met should be established in advance of the trial by means of prior information and data. There are additional problems that need careful attention in crossover trials. The most notable of these are the complications of analysis and interpretation arising from the loss of subjects. Also, the potent ial for carryover leads to difficulties in assigning adverse events which occur in later treatment periods to the appropriate 11 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials treatment. These, and other issues, are de scribed in ICH E4. The crossover design should generally be restricted to situations where losses of subjects from the trial are expected to be small. A common, and generally satisfactory, use of the 2×2 crossover design is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of two formulations of the same medication. In this particular application in healthy volunteers, carryover effects on the relevant pharmacokinetic variable are most unlikely to occur if the wash-out time between the two periods is sufficiently long. However it is still important to check this assumption during analysis on the basis of the data obtained, for example by demonstrating that no drug is detectable at the start of each period. 3.1.3 Factorial Designs In a factorial design two or more treat ments are evaluated simultaneously through the use of varying combinations of the treatments. The simplest example is the 2×2 factorial design in which subjects are rand omly allocated to one of the four possible combinations of two treatments, A and B say. These are: A alone; B alone; both A and B; neither A nor B. In many cases this design is used for the specific purpose of examining the interaction of A and B. The statistical test of interaction may lack power to detect an interaction if the sample size was calculated based on the test for main effects. This consideration is important when this design is used for examining the joint effects of A and B, in particular, if the treatments are likely to be used together. Another important use of the factorial design is to establish the dose-response characteristics of the simultaneous use of treatments C and D, especially when the efficacy of each monotherapy has been est ablished at some dose in prior trials. A number, m, of doses of C is selected, usua lly including a zero dose (placebo), and a similar number, n, of doses of D. The full design then consists of m×n treatment groups, each receiving a different combinat ion of doses of C and D. The resulting estimate of the response surface may then be used to help to identify an appropriate combination of doses of C and D for clinical use (see ICH E4). In some cases, the 2×2 design may be used to make efficient use of clinical trial subjects by evaluating the efficacy of th e two treatments with the same number of subjects as would be required to evaluate the efficacy of either one alone. This strategy has proved to be particularly va luable for very large mortality trials. The efficiency and validity of this approach depends upon the absence of interaction between treatments A and B so that the effe cts of A and B on the primary efficacy variables follow an additive model, and hence the effect of A is virtually identical whether or not it is additional to the effe ct of B. As for the crossover trial, evidence that this condition is likely to be met should be established in advance of the trial by means of prior information and data. 3.2 Multicentre Trials Multicentre trials are carried out for two main reasons. Firstly, a multicentre trial is an accepted way of evaluating a new medi cation more efficiently; under some circumstances, it may present the only practical means of accruing sufficient subjects to satisfy the trial objective within a reas onable time-frame. Multicentre trials of this nature may, in principle, be carried out at any stage of clinical development. They may have several centres with a large number of subjects per centre or, in the case of a rare disease, they may have a large numbe r of centres with ve ry few subjects per centre. Secondly, a trial may be designed as a mu lticentre (and multi-investigator) trial primarily to provide a better basis for the subsequent generalisation of its findings. 12 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials This arises from the possibility of recruitin g the subjects from a wider population and"}

In this case the involvement of a number of investigators also gives the potential for a wider range of clinical judgement concerning the value of the medication. Such a trial would be a confirmatory trial in the later phases of drug development and would be likely to involve a large number of investigators and centres. It might sometimes be conducted in a number of different countries in orde r to facilitate generalisability (see Glossary) even further. If a multicentre trial is to be meaningfu lly interpreted and extrapolated, then the manner in which the protocol is implemented should be clear and similar at all centres. Furthermore the usual sample size and power calculations depend upon the assumption that the differences between th e compared treatments in the centres are unbiased estimates of the same quantity. It is important to design the common protocol and to conduct the trial with this background in mind. Procedures should be standardised as completely as possible. Va riation of evaluation criteria and schemes can be reduced by investigator meetings, by the training of personnel in advance of the trial and by careful monitoring during the trial. Good design should generally aim to achieve the same distribution of subjects to treatments within each centre and good management should maintain this design objective. Trials that avoid excessive variation in the numbers of subjects per ce ntre and trials that avoid a few very small centres have advantages if it is later fo und necessary to take into account the heterogeneity of the treatment effect from centre to centre, because they reduce the differences between different weighted esti mates of the treatment effect. (This point does not apply to trials in which all centre s are very small and in which centre does not feature in the analysis.) Failure to take these precautions, combined with doubts about the homogeneity of the results may, in severe cases, reduce the value of a multicentre trial to such a degree that it cannot be regarded as giving convincing evidence for the sponsor’s claims. In the simplest multicentre trial, each invest igator will be responsible for the subjects recruited at one hospital, so that ‘centre’ is identified uniquely by either investigator or hospital. In many trials, however, the si tuation is more complex. One investigator may recruit subjects from several hospitals; one investigator may represent a team of clinicians (subinvestigators) who all recruit subjects from their own clinics at one hospital or at several associated hospitals. Whenever there is room for doubt about the definition of centre in a statistical model, the statistical section of the protocol (see Section 5.1) should clearly define the term (e.g. by investigator, location or region) in the context of the particular trial. In most instances centres can be satisfactorily defined through the investigators and ICH E6 provides relevant guidance in this respect. In cases of doubt the aim should be to define centres so as to achieve homogeneity in the important factors affe cting the measurements of the primary variables and the influence of the treatment s. Any rules for combining centres in the analysis should be justified and specified pr ospectively in the protocol where possible, but in any case decisions concerning this approach should always be taken blind to treatment, for example at the time of the blind review. The statistical model to be adopted for the estimation and testing of treatment effects should be described in the protocol. The main treatment effect may be investigated first using a model which allows for centre differences, but does not include a term for treatment-by-centre interaction. If the treatment effect is homogeneous across centres, the routine inclusion of interaction terms in the model reduces the efficiency of the test for the main effects. In the pr esence of true heterogeneity of treatment effects, the interpretation of the main treatment effect is controversial. 13 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials In some trials, for example some large mo rtality trials with very few subjects per centre, there may be no reason to expect the centres to have any influence on the primary or secondary variables because they are unlikely to represent influences of clinical importance. In other trials it may be recognised from the start that the limited numbers of subjects per centre will make it impracticable to include the centre effects in the"}

In other trials it may be recognised from the start that the limited numbers of subjects per centre will make it impracticable to include the centre effects in the statistical model. In these cases it is not appropriate to include a term for centre in the model, and it is not necessary to stratify the randomisation by centre in this situation. If positive treatment effects are found in a trial with appreciable numbers of subjects per centre, there should generally be an expl oration of the heterogeneity of treatment effects across centres, as this may affe ct the generalisability of the conclusions. Marked heterogeneity may be identified by graphical display of the results of individual centres or by analytical methods, such as a significance test of the treatment-by-centre interaction. When using su ch a statistical significance test, it is important to recognise that this generally has low power in a trial designed to detect the main effect of treatment. If heterogeneity of treatment effects is found , this should be interpreted with care and vigorous attempts should be made to find an explanation in terms of other features of trial management or subject characteristic s. Such an explanation will usually suggest appropriate further analysis and interpretation. In the absence of an explanation, heterogeneity of treatment effect as eviden ced, for example, by marked quantitative interactions (see Glossary) implies that alte rnative estimates of the treatment effect may be required, giving differe nt weights to the centres, in order to substantiate the robustness of the estimates of treatment effect. It is even more important to understand the basis of any heterogeneit y characterised by marked qualitative interactions (see Glossary), and failure to find an explanation may necessitate further clinical trials before the treatment effect can be reliably predicted. Up to this point the discussion of multicentre trials has been based on the use of fixed effect models. Mixed models may also be us ed to explore the heterogeneity of the treatment effect. These models consider cen tre and treatment-by-ce ntre effects to be random, and are especially relevant when the number of sites is large. 3.3 Type of Comparison 3.3.1 Trials to Show Superiority Scientifically, efficacy is most convincing ly established by demonstrating superiority to placebo in a placebo-controlled trial, by showing superiority to an active control treatment or by demonstrating a dose-respo nse relationship. This type of trial is referred to as a ‘superiority’ trial (see Glossary). Generally in this guidance superiority trials are assumed, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise. For serious illnesses, when a therapeutic treatment which has been shown to be efficacious by superiority trial(s) exists, a placebo-controlled trial may be considered unethical. In that case the scientifically so und use of an active treatment as a control should be considered. The appropriateness of placebo control vs. active control should be considered on a trial by trial basis. 3.3.2 Trials to Show Equivalence or Non-inferiority In some cases, an investigational produ ct is compared to a reference treatment without the objective of showing superiority. This type of trial is divided into two major categories according to its objective; one is an 'equivalence' trial (see Glossary) and the other is a 'non-inferiority' trial (see Glossary). 14 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Bioequivalence trials fall into the former category. In some situations, clinical equivalence trials are also undertaken fo r other regulatory reasons such as demonstrating the clinical equivalence of a generic product to the marketed product when the compound is not absorbed and therefore not present in the blood stream. Many active control trials are designed to sh ow that the efficacy of an investigational product is no worse than that of the active comparator, and hence fall into the latter category. Another possibility is a trial in wh ich multiple doses of the investigational drug are compared with the recommended dose or multiple doses of the standard drug. The purpose of this design is simultaneously to show a dose-response relationship for the investigational prod uct and to compare the investigational product with the active control. Active control equivalence or non-inferior ity trials may also incorporate a placebo, thus pursuing multiple goals in one trial; for example, they may establish superiority to placebo and hence validate the trial design and simultaneously evaluate the degree of similarity of efficacy and safety to the active comparator. There are well known difficulties associated with the use of the active control equivalence (or non- inferiority) trials that do not incorporate a placebo or do not use multiple doses of the new drug. These relate to the implicit lack of any measure of internal validity (in contrast to superiority trials), thus ma"}

These relate to the implicit lack of any measure of internal validity (in contrast to superiority trials), thus ma king external validation necessary. The equivalence (or non-inferiority) trial is not conservative in nature, so that many flaws in the design or conduct of the trial will te nd to bias the results towards a conclusion of equivalence. For these reasons, the design features of such trials should receive special attention and their conduct needs spec ial care. For example, it is especially important to minimise the incidence of violations of the entry criteria, non- compliance, withdrawals, losses to follow-up , missing data and other deviations from the protocol, and also to minimise their impact on the subsequent analyses. Active comparators should be chosen with care. An example of a suitable active comparator would be a widely used therapy whose efficacy in the relevant indication has been clearly established and quantified in well designed and well documented superiority trial(s) and which can be reliably expected to exhibit similar efficacy in the contemplated active control trial. To this end, the new trial should have the same important design features (primary variabl es, the dose of the active comparator, eligibility criteria, etc.) as the previously conducted superiority trials in which the active comparator clearly demonstrated clinically relevant efficacy, taking into account advances in medical or statistical practice relevant to the new trial. It is vital that the protocol of a trial designed to demonstrate equivalence or non- inferiority contain a clear statement that this is its explicit intention. An equivalence margin should be specified in the protocol; this margin is the largest difference that can be judged as being clinically accept able and should be smaller than differences observed in superiority trials of the a ctive comparator. For the active control equivalence trial, both the upper and the lower equivalence margins are needed, while only the lower margin is needed for the acti ve control non-inferiority trial. The choice of equivalence margins should be justified clinically. Statistical analysis is generally based on the use of confidence intervals (see Section 5.5). For equivalence trials, two-sided confidence intervals should be used. Equivalence is inferred when the entire confidence interval falls within the equivalence margins. Operationally, this is equivalent to the method of using two simultaneous one-sided tests to test the (composite) null hypothesis that the treatment difference is outside the equi valence margins versus the (composite) alternative hypothesis that the treatment difference is within the margins. Because the two null hypotheses are disjoint, the type I error is appropriately controlled. For 15 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials non-inferiority trials a one-sided interval should be used. The confidence interval approach has a one-sided hypothesis test counterpart for testing the null hypothesis that the treatment difference (investigational product minus control) is equal to the lower equivalence margin versus the alte rnative that the treatment difference is greater than the lower equivalence margin. Th e choice of type I error should be a consideration separate from the use of a one-sided or two-sided procedure. Sample size calculations should be based on these methods (see Section 3.5). Concluding equivalence or non-inferiority based on observing a non-significant test result of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the investigational product and the active comparator is inappropriate. There are also special issues in the choice of analysis sets. Subjects who withdraw or dropout of the treatment group or the comp arator group will tend to have a lack of response, and hence the results of using the full analysis set (see Glossary) may be biased toward demonstrating equivalence (see Section 5.2.3). 3.3.3 Trials to Show Dose-response Relationship How response is related to the dose of a new investigational product is a question to which answers may be obtained in all phases of development, and by a variety of approaches (see ICH E4). Dose-response trials may serve a number of objectives, amongst which the following are of particular importance: the confirmation of efficacy; the investigation of the shape and location of the dose-response curve; the estimation of an appropriate starting dose; the identifica tion of optimal strategies for individual dose adjustments; the determination of a maximal dose beyond which additional benefit would be unlikely to occur. These objectives should be addressed using the data collected at a number of doses under investigation, including a placebo (zero dose) wherever appropriate. For this purpose the application of procedures to estimate the relationship between dose and response , including the construction of confidence intervals and the use of graphical methods, is as important as the use of statistical tests.

For this purpose the application of procedures to estimate the relationship between dose and response , including the construction of confidence intervals and the use of graphical methods, is as important as the use of statistical tests. The hypothesis tests that are used may need to be tailored to the natural ordering of doses or to particular questions regarding the shape of the dose-response curve (e.g. monotonicity). The details of th e planned statistical procedures should be given in the protocol. 3.4 Group Sequential Designs Group sequential designs are used to facilitate the conduct of interim analysis (see section 4.5 and Glossary). While group sequential designs are not the only acceptable types of designs permitting interim analys is, they are the most commonly applied because it is more practicable to assess gr ouped subject outcomes at periodic intervals during the trial than on a continuous basis as data from each subject become available. The statistical methods should be fully specified in advance of the availability of information on treatment outcomes and subject treatment assignments (i.e. blind breaking, see Section 4.5). An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (see Glossary) may be used to review or to co nduct the interim analysis of data arising from a group sequential design (see Section 4.6). While the design has been most widely and successfully used in large, long -term trials of mortality or major non-fatal endpoints, its use is growing in other circumstances. In particular, it is recognised that safety must be monitored in all trials and therefore the need for formal procedures to cover early stopping for safety reasons should always be considered. 3.5 Sample Size The number of subjects in a clinical trial should always be large enough to provide a reliable answer to the questions addressed. This number is usually determined by the 16 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials primary objective of the trial. If the sample size is determined on some other basis, then this should be made clear and justified. For example, a trial sized on the basis of safety questions or requirements or import ant secondary objectives may need larger numbers of subjects than a trial sized on the basis of the primary efficacy question (see, for example, ICH E1a). Using the usual method for determining th e appropriate sample size, the following items should be specified: a primary variabl e, the test statistic, the null hypothesis, the alternative ('working') hypothesis at th e chosen dose(s) (embodying consideration of the treatment difference to be detected or rejected at the dose and in the subject population selected), the probability of erro neously rejecting the null hypothesis (the type I error), and the probability of erron eously failing to reject the null hypothesis (the type II error), as well as the approach to dealing with treatment withdrawals and protocol violations. In some instances, the event rate is of primary interest for evaluating power, and assumptions should be made to extrapolate from the required number of events to the eventual sample size for the trial. The method by which the sample size is calculated should be given in the protocol, together with the estimates of any quantities used in the calculations (such as variances, mean values, response rates, even t rates, difference to be detected). The basis of these estimates should also be given. It is important to investigate the sensitivity of the sample size estimate to a variety of deviations from these assumptions and this may be facilitated by providing a range of sample sizes appropriate for a reasonable range of deviat ions from assumptions. In confirmatory trials, assumptions should normally be based on published data or on the results of earlier trials. The treatment difference to be detected may be based on a judgement concerning the minimal effect which has c linical relevance in the management of patients or on a judgement concerning th e anticipated effect of the new treatment, where this is larger. Conventionally the pro bability of type I error is set at 5% or less or as dictated by any adjustments made necessary for multiplicity considerations; the precise choice may be influenced by the prior plausibility of the hypothesis under test and the desired impact of the results. The probability of type II error is conventionally set at 10% to 20%; it is in the sponsor’s intere st to keep this figure as low as feasible especially in the case of trials that are difficult or impossible to repeat. Alternative values to the conventional levels of type I and type II error may be acceptable or even preferable in some cases. Sample size calculations should refer to the number of subjects required for the primary analysis. If this is the 'full analysis set', estimates of the"}

Alternative values to the conventional levels of type I and type II error may be acceptable or even preferable in some cases. Sample size calculations should refer to the number of subjects required for the primary analysis. If this is the 'full analysis set', estimates of the effect size may need to be reduced compared to the per protocol set (see Glossary). This is to allow for the dilution of the treatment effect arising from the inclusion of data from patients who have withdrawn from treatment or whose co mpliance is poor. The assumptions about variability may also need to be revised. The sample size of an equivalence trial or a non-inferiority trial (see Section 3.3.2) should normally be based on the objective of obtaining a confidence interval for the treatment difference that shows that the tre atments differ at most by a clinically acceptable difference. When the power of an equivalence trial is assessed at a true difference of zero, then the sample size necessary to achieve this power is underestimated if the true difference is not zero. When the power of a non-inferiority trial is assessed at a zero difference, then the sample size needed to achieve that power will be underestimated if the effect of the investigational product is less than that of the active control. The choice of a 'clinically acceptable’ difference needs justification with respect to its meaning for future patients, and may be smaller than the 'clinically relevant' difference referred to above in the context of superiority trials designed to establish that a difference exists. 17 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials The exact sample size in a group sequential trial cannot be fixed in advance because it depends upon the play of chance in combination with the chosen stopping guideline and the true treatment difference. The design of the stopping guideline should take into account the consequent distribution of the sample size, usually embodied in the expected and maximum sample sizes. When event rates are lower than anticipated or variability is larger than expected, methods for sample size re-estimation are available without unblinding data or making treatment comparisons (see Section 4.4). 3.6 Data Capture and Processing The collection of data and transfer of data from the investigator to the sponsor can take place through a variety of media, includ ing paper case record forms, remote site monitoring systems, medical computer sy stems and electronic transfer. Whatever data capture instrument is used, the form and content of the information collected should be in full accordance with the protocol and should be established in advance of the conduct of the clinical trial. It should focus on the data necessary to implement the planned analysis, including the context information (such as timing assessments relative to dosing) necessary to confirm protocol compliance or identify important protocol deviations. ‘Missing values’ should be distinguishable from the ‘value zero’ or ‘characteristic absent’. The process of data capture through to database finalisation should be carried out in accordance with GCP (see ICH E6, Section 5). Specifically, timely and reliable processes for recording data and rectifyin g errors and omissions are necessary to ensure delivery of a quality database and the achievement of the trial objectives through the implementation of the planned analysis. IV. TRIAL CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS 4.1 Trial Monitoring and Interim Analysis Careful conduct of a clinical trial according to the protocol has a major impact on the credibility of the results (see ICH E6). Carefu l monitoring can ensure that difficulties are noticed early and their occurrence or recurrence minimised. There are two distinct types of monitoring that generally characterise confirmatory clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceut ical industry. One type of monitoring concerns the oversight of the quality of the trial, while the other type involves breaking the blind to make treatment comp arisons (i.e. interim analysis). Both types of trial monitoring, in addition to entailing different staff responsibilities, involve access to different types of trial data and information, and thus different principles apply for the control of potential statistical and operational bias. For the purpose of overseeing the quality of the trial the checks involved in trial monitoring may include whether the protocol is being followed, the acceptability of data being accrued, the success of planned accrual targets, the appropriateness of the design assumptions, success in keeping patients in the trials, etc. (see Sections 4.2 to 4.4). This type of monitoring does not re quire access to information on comparative treatment effects, nor unblinding of data and therefore has no impact on type I error. The monitoring of a trial for this purpose is the responsibility of the sponsor (see ICH E6) and can be carried out by the sponsor or an independent group selected by the sponsor. The period for this type of monitoring usually"}

This type of monitoring does not re quire access to information on comparative treatment effects, nor unblinding of data and therefore has no impact on type I error. The monitoring of a trial for this purpose is the responsibility of the sponsor (see ICH E6) and can be carried out by the sponsor or an independent group selected by the sponsor. The period for this type of monitoring usually starts with the selection of the trial sites and ends with the collection and cleaning of the last subject’s data. The other type of trial monitoring (interim analysis) involves the accruing of comparative treatment results. Interim analysis requires unblinded (i.e. key 18 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials breaking) access to treatment group assign ment (actual treatment assignment or identification of group assignment) and comparative treatment group summary information. This necessitates that the prot ocol (or appropriate amendments prior to a first analysis) contains statistical plans for the interim analysis to prevent certain types of bias. This is discussed in Sections 4.5 & 4.6. 4.2 Changes in Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion and exclusion criteria should remain constant, as specified in the protocol, throughout the period of subject recru itment. Changes may occasionally be appropriate, for example, in long term trials, where growing medical knowledge either from outside the trial or from interim analyses may suggest a change of entry criteria. Changes may also result from the discov ery by monitoring staff that regular violations of the entry criteria are occurring , or that seriously low recruitment rates are due to over-restrictive criteria. Changes should be made without breaking the blind and should always be described by a protocol amendment which should cover any statistical consequences, such as sample size adjustments arising from different event rates, or modifications to the planne d analysis, such as stratifying the analysis according to modified inclusion/exclusion criteria. 4.3 Accrual Rates In trials with a long time-scale for the accr ual of subjects, the rate of accrual should be monitored and, if it falls appreciably be low the projected level, the reasons should be identified and remedial actions taken in order to protect the power of the trial and alleviate concerns about selective entry and other aspects of quality. In a multicentre trial these considerations apply to the individual centres. 4.4 Sample Size Adjustment In long term trials there will usually be an opportunity to check the assumptions which underlay the original design and sample size calculations. This may be particularly important if the trial specifications have been made on preliminary and/or uncertain information. An interim check conducted on the blinded data may reveal that overall response variances, even t rates or survival experience are not as anticipated. A revised sample size may then be calculated using suitably modified assumptions, and should be justified and documented in a protocol amendment and in the clinical study report. The steps taken to preserve blindness and the consequences, if any, for the type I error and the width of confidence intervals should be explained. The potential need for re-estimation of the sample size should be envisaged in the protocol whenever possible (see Section 3.5). 4.5 Interim Analysis and Early Stopping An interim analysis is any analysis intended to compare treatment arms with respect to efficacy or safety at any time prior to formal completion of a trial. Because the number, methods and consequences of these comparisons affect the interpretation of the trial, all interim analyses should be ca refully planned in advance and described in the protocol. Special circumstances may dictate the need for an interim analysis that was not defined at the start of a trial. In these cases, a protocol amendment describing the interim analysis should be complete d prior to unblinded access to treatment comparison data. When an interim analysis is planned with the intention of deciding whether or not to terminate a trial, this is usually accomplished by the use of a group sequential design which employs statistical monitoring schemes as guidelines (see Section 3.4). The goal of such an interim analysis is to stop the trial early if the superiority of the treatment under study is clearly established, if the demonstration of 19 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials a relevant treatment difference has become unlikely or if unacceptable adverse effects are apparent. Generally, boundaries for monito ring efficacy require more evidence to terminate a trial early (i.e. they are more conservative) than boundaries for monitoring safety. When the trial design and monitoring objective involve multiple endpoints then this aspect of multiplicity may also need to be taken into account. The protocol should describe the schedule of interim analyses, or at least the considerations which will govern its generati on, for example if flexible alpha spending function approaches are to be employed; further details may be given in a protocol amendment before the time of the first interim analysis. The stopping guidelines and their properties"}

The stopping guidelines and their properties should be clearly described in the protocol or amendments. The potential effects of early stopping on the analysis of other important variables should also be considered. This material should be written or approved by the Data Monitoring Committee (see Section 4.6), when the trial has one. Deviations from the planned procedure always bear the potential of invalidating the trial results. If it becomes necessary to make changes to th e trial, any consequent changes to the statistical procedures should be specifie d in an amendment to the protocol at the earliest opportunity, especially discussing the impact on any analysis and inferences that such changes may cause. The procedures selected should always ensure that the overall probability of type I error is controlled. The execution of an interim analysis should be a completely confidential process because unblinded data and results are potent ially involved. All staff involved in the conduct of the trial should remain blind to the results of such analyses, because of the possibility that their attitudes to the trial will be modified and cause changes in the characteristics of patients to be recruited or biases in treatment comparisons. This principle may be applied to all investigator staff and to staff employed by the sponsor except for those who are directly involved in the execution of the interim analysis. Investigators should only be informed about the decision to continue or to discontinue the trial, or to implement modifications to trial procedures. Most clinical trials intended to support th e efficacy and safety of an investigational product should proceed to full completion of planned sample size accrual; trials should be stopped early only for ethical reasons or if the power is no longer acceptable. However, it is recognised that drug deve lopment plans involve the need for sponsor access to comparative treatment data for a va riety of reasons, such as planning other trials. It is also recognised that only a subset of trials will involve the study of serious life-threatening outcomes or mortality which may need sequential monitoring of accruing comparative treatment effects for ethical reasons. In either of these situations, plans for interim statistical analysis should be in place in the protocol or in protocol amendments prior to the unblinded access to comparative treatment data in order to deal with the potential statis tical and operational bias that may be introduced. For many clinical trials of investigational products, especially those that have major public health significance, the responsibilit y for monitoring comparisons of efficacy and/or safety outcomes should be assigned to an external independent group, often called an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), a Data and Safety Monitoring Board or a Data Monitoring Co mmittee whose responsibilities should be clearly described. When a sponsor assumes the role of monito ring efficacy or safety comparisons and therefore has access to unblinded comparative information, particular care should be taken to protect the integrity of the trial and to manage and limit appropriately the sharing of information. The sponsor should assure and document that the internal monitoring committee has complied with written standard operating procedures and 20 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials that minutes of decision making meetings including records of interim results are maintained. Any interim analysis that is not planne d appropriately (with or without the consequences of stopping the trial early) may flaw the results of a trial and possibly weaken confidence in the conclusions drawn. Therefore, such analyses should be avoided. If unplanned interim analysis is co nducted, the clinical study report should explain why it was necessary, the degree to which blindness had to be broken, provide an assessment of the potential magnitude of bias introduced, and the impact on the interpretation of the results. 4.6 Role of Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) (see Sections 1.25 and 5.52 of ICH E6) An IDMC may be established by the sponsor to assess at intervals the progress of a clinical trial, safety data, and critical efficacy variables and recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or terminat e a trial.

The IDMC should have written operating procedures and maintain record s of all its meetings, including interim results; these should be available for review when the trial is complete. The independence of the IDMC is intended to control the sharing of important comparative information and to protect the in tegrity of the clinical trial from adverse impact resulting from access to trial informat ion. The IDMC is a separate entity from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), and its composition should include clinical trial scientists knowledgeable in the appropriate disciplines including statistics. When there are sponsor representatives on the IDMC, their role should be clearly defined in the operating procedures of th e committee (for example, covering whether or not they can vote on key issues). Si nce these sponsor staff would have access to unblinded information, the procedures should also address the control of dissemination of interim trial results within the sponsor organisation. V. DATA ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS 5.1 Prespecification of the Analysis When designing a clinical trial the principal features of the eventual statistical analysis of the data should be described in the statistical section of the protocol. This section should include all the principal feat ures of the proposed confirmatory analysis of the primary variable(s) and the way in which anticipated analysis problems will be handled. In case of exploratory trials th is section could describe more general principles and directions. The statistical analysis plan (see Glossary) ma y be written as a separate document to be completed after finalising the protocol. In this document, a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features stated in the protocol may be included (see section 7.1). The plan may include detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. The plan should be reviewed and possibly updated as a result of the blind review of the data (see 7.1 for definition) and should be finalised before breaking the blind. Formal records should be kept of when the statistical analysis plan was finalised as well as when the blind was subsequently broken. If the blind review suggests changes to the principal features stated in the protocol, these should be documented in a protocol amendment. Otherwise, it will suffice to update the statistical analysis plan with the considerations suggested from the blind review. Only results from analyses envisage d in the protocol (including amendments) can be regarded as confirmatory. 21 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials In the statistical section of the clinical st udy report the statistical methodology should be clearly described including when in the clinical trial process methodology decisions were made (see ICH E3). 5.2 Analysis Sets The set of subjects whose data are to be included in the main analyses should be defined in the statistical section of the pr otocol. In addition, documentation for all subjects for whom trial procedures (e.g. r un-in period) were initiated may be useful. The content of this subject documentation depends on detailed features of the particular trial, but at least demographic and baseline data on disease status should be collected whenever possible. If all subjects randomised into a clinical trial satisfied all entry criteria, followed all trial procedures perfectly with no losses to follow-up, and provided complete data records, then the set of subjects to be in cluded in the analysis would be self-evident. The design and conduct of a trial should aim to approach this ideal as closely as possible, but, in practice, it is doubtful if it can ever be fully achieved. Hence, the statistical section of the protocol should a ddress anticipated problems prospectively in terms of how these affect the subjects and data to be analysed. The protocol should also specify procedures aimed at minimising any anticipated irregularities in study conduct that might impair a satisfactory anal ysis, including various types of protocol violations, withdrawals and missing values. The protocol should consider ways both to reduce the frequency of such problems, and also to handle the problems that do occur in the analysis of data. Possible amendments to the way in which the analysis will deal with protocol violations should be identified during the blind review. It is desirable to identify any important protocol violation with respect to the time when it occurred, its cause and influence on the trial result. The frequency and type of protocol violations, missing values, and ot her problems should be documented in the clinical study report and their potential in fluence on the trial results should be described (see ICH E3). Decisions concerning the analysis set should be guided by the following principles : 1) to minimise bias, and 2) to avoid inflation of type I error. 5.2.1 Full Analysis Set The intention-to-treat (see Glossary) prin ciple implies that the primary analysis should include all randomised subjects. Compliance with this principle would necessitate complete follow-up of all rand omised subjects for study outcomes. In practice this"}

Compliance with this principle would necessitate complete follow-up of all rand omised subjects for study outcomes. In practice this ideal may be difficult to achieve, for reasons to be described. In this document the term 'full analysis set' is used to describe the analysis set which is as complete as possible and as close as possible to the intention-to-treat ideal of including all randomised subjects. Preser vation of the initial randomisation in analysis is important in preventing bias and in providing a secure foundation for statistical tests. In many clinical trials the use of the full analysis set provides a conservative strategy. Under many circumst ances it may also provide estimates of treatment effects which are more likely to mirror those observed in subsequent practice. There are a limited number of circumstances that might lead to excluding randomised subjects from the full analysis set including the failure to satisfy major entry criteria (eligibility violations), the failure to take at least one dose of trial medication and the lack of any data post randomisation. Such exclusions should always be justified. Subjects who fail to satisfy an entry crite rion may be excluded from the analysis without the possibility of introducing bias only under the following circumstances: (i) the entry criterion was measured prior to randomisation; 22 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ii) the detection of the relevant eligib ility violations can be made completely objectively; (iii) all subjects receive equal scrutiny for eligibility violations; (This may be difficult to ensure in an open-label study, or even in a double-blind study if the data are unblinded prior to this scrutiny, emphasising the importance of the blind review.) (iv) all detected violations of the particular entry criterion are excluded. In some situations, it may be reasonable to eliminate from the set of all randomised subjects any subject who took no trial me dication. The intention-to-treat principle would be preserved despite the exclusion of these patients provided, for example, that the decision of whether or not to begi n treatment could not be influenced by knowledge of the assigned treatment. In ot her situations it may be necessary to eliminate from the set of all randomised subjects any subject without data post randomisation. No analysis is complete unless the potential biases arising from these specific exclusions, or any others, are addressed. When the full analysis set of subjects is used, violations of the protocol that occur after randomisation may have an impact on the data and conclusions, particularly if their occurrence is related to treatment assignment. In most respects it is appropriate to include the data from such subjects in the analysis, consistent with the intention- to-treat principle. Special problems arise in connection with subjects withdrawn from treatment after receiving one or more doses who provide no data after this point, and subjects otherwise lost to follow-up, becaus e failure to include these subjects in the full analysis set may seriously undermine the approach. Measurements of primary variables made at the time of the loss to follow-up of a subject for any reason, or subsequently collected in accordance with the intended schedule of assessments in the protocol, are valuable in this context; subsequent collection is especially important in studies where the primary variable is mortality or serious morbidity. The intention to collect data in this way should be describe d in the protocol. Imputation techniques, ranging from the carrying forward of the last observation to the use of complex mathematical models, may also be used in an attempt to compensate for missing data. Other methods employed to ensure the availability of measurements of primary variables for every subject in the full anal ysis set may require some assumptions about the subjects' outcomes or a simpler choice of outcome (e.g. success / failure). The use of any of these strategies should be described and justified in the statistical section of the protocol and the assumptions underlying any mathematical models employed should be clearly explained. It is also important to demonstrate the robustness of the corresponding results of analysis especially when the strategy in question could itself lead to biased estimates of treatment effects. Because of the unpredictability of some prob lems, it may sometimes be preferable to defer detailed consideration of the manner of dealing with irregularities until the blind review of the data at the end of the trial, and, if so, this should be stated in the protocol. 5.2.2 Per Protocol Set The 'per protocol' set of subjects, sometimes described as the 'valid cases', the 'efficacy' sample or the 'evaluable subjects' sample, defines a subset of the subjects in the full analysis"}

The precise reasons for excluding subjects fr om the per protocol set should be fully defined and documented before breaking the blind in a manner appropriate to the circumstances of the specific trial. The use of the per protocol set may maximi se the opportunity for a new treatment to show additional efficacy in the analysis, and most closely reflects the scientific model underlying the protocol. However, the corre sponding test of the hypothesis and estimate of the treatment effect may or ma y not be conservative depending on the trial; the bias, which may be severe, arises from the fact that adherence to the study protocol may be related to treatment and outcome. The problems that lead to the exclusion of subjects to create the per protocol set, and other protocol violations, should be fully identified and summarised. Relevant protocol violations may include errors in treatment assignment, the use of excluded medication, poor compliance, loss to follow-up and missing data. It is good practice to assess the pattern of such problems among the treatment groups with respect to frequency and time to occurrence. 5.2.3 Roles of the Different Analysis Sets In general, it is advantageous to demonstrate a lack of sensitivity of the principal trial results to alternative choices of the set of subjects analysed. In confirmatory trials it is usually appropriate to plan to conduct both an analysis of the full analysis set and a per protocol analysis, so that any differenc es between them can be the subject of explicit discussion and interpretation. In some cases, it may be desirable to plan further exploration of the sensitivity of conclu sions to the choice of the set of subjects analysed. When the full analysis set and the per protocol set lead to essentially the same conclusions, confidence in the trial results is increased, bearing in mind, however, that the need to exclude a subst antial proportion of subjects from the per protocol analysis throws some doubt on the overall validity of the trial. The full analysis set and the per protocol set play different roles in superiority trials (which seek to show the investigational prod uct to be superior), and in equivalence or non-inferiority trials (which seek to sh ow the investigational product to be comparable, see section 3.3.2). In superiority trials the full analysis set is used in the primary analysis (apart from exceptional circumstances) because it tends to avoid over-optimistic estimates of efficacy resulting from a per protocol analysis, since the non-compliers included in the full analysis set will generally diminish the estimated treatment effect. However, in an equivalenc e or non-inferiority trial use of the full analysis set is generally not conservative and its role should be considered very carefully. 5.3 Missing Values and Outliers Missing values represent a potential source of bias in a clinical trial. Hence, every effort should be undertaken to fulfil all the requirements of the protocol concerning the collection and management of data. In re ality, however, there will almost always be some missing data. A trial may be rega rded as valid, nonetheless, provided the methods of dealing with missing values are sensible, and particularly if those methods are pre-defined in the protocol. De finition of methods may be refined by updating this aspect in the statistica l analysis plan during the blind review. Unfortunately, no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended. An investigation should be made concerning the sensitivity of the 24 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials results of analysis to the method of handling missing values, especially if the number of missing values is substantial. A similar approach should be adopted to exploring the influence of outliers, the statistical definition of which is, to some extent, arbitrary. Clear identification of a particular value as an outlier is most convincing when justified medically as well as statistically, and the medical context will th en often define the appropriate action. Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favour any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully"}

Any outlier procedure set out in the protocol or the statistical analysis plan should be such as not to favour any treatment group a priori. Once again, this aspect of the analysis can be usefully updated during blin d review. If no procedure for dealing with outliers was foreseen in the trial protocol, one analysis with the actual values and at least one other analysis eliminating or reduci ng the outlier effect should be performed and differences between their results discussed. 5.4 Data Transformation The decision to transform key variables pr ior to analysis is best made during the design of the trial on the basis of similar data from earlier clinical trials. Transformations (e.g. square root, logarithm) should be specified in the protocol and a rationale provided, especially for the pr imary variable(s). The general principles guiding the use of transformations to ensure that the assumptions underlying the statistical methods are met are to be fo und in standard texts; conventions for particular variables have been developed in a number of specific clinical areas. The decision on whether and how to transform a variable should be influenced by the preference for a scale which facilitates clinical interpretation. Similar considerations apply to other deri ved variables, such as the use of change from baseline, percentage change from baseline, the 'area under the curve' of repeated measures, or the ratio of two different vari ables. Subsequent clinical interpretation should be carefully considered, and the deriva tion should be justified in the protocol. Closely related points are made in Section 2.2.2. 5.5 Estimation, Confidence Inte rvals and Hypothesis Testing The statistical section of the protocol shou ld specify the hypotheses that are to be tested and/or the treatment effects which are to be estimated in order to satisfy the primary objectives of the trial. The statistica l methods to be used to accomplish these tasks should be described for the primary (and preferably the secondary) variables, and the underlying statistical model should be made clear. Estimates of treatment effects should be accompanied by confidence intervals, whenever possible, and the way in which these will be calculated should be identified. A description should be given of any intentions to use baseline da ta to improve precision or to adjust estimates for potential baseline differences , for example by means of analysis of covariance. It is important to clarify whether one- or two-sided tests of statistical significance will be used, and in particular to justify pros pectively the use of one-sided tests. If hypothesis tests are not considered approp riate, then the alternative process for arriving at statistical conclusions should be given. The issue of one-sided or two-sided approaches to inference is controversial and a diversity of views can be found in the statistical literature. The approach of setting type I errors for one-sided tests at half the conventional type I error used in tw o-sided tests is preferable in regulatory settings. This promotes consistency with th e two-sided confidence intervals that are generally appropriate for estimating the po ssible size of the difference between two treatments. The particular statistical model chosen should reflect the current state of medical and statistical knowledge about the variables to be analysed as well as the statistical 25 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials design of the trial. All effects to be fitte d in the analysis (for example in analysis of variance models) should be fully specified, and the manner, if any, in which this set of effects might be modified in response to pr eliminary results should be explained. The same considerations apply to the set of co variates fitted in an analysis of covariance. (See also Section 5.7.). In the choice of statistical methods due attention should be paid to the statistical distribution of bo th primary and secondary variables. When making this choice (for example between parametric and non-parametric methods) it is important to bear in mind the need to provide statistical estimates of the size of treatment effects together with confidence intervals (in addition to significance tests). The primary analysis of the primary variable should be clearly distinguished from supporting analyses of the primary or secondary variables. Within the statistical section of the protocol or the statistical analysis plan there should also be an outline of the way in which data other than the primary and secondary variables will be summarised and reported. This should incl ude a reference to any approaches adopted for the purpose of achieving consistency of analysis across a range of trials, for example for safety data. Modelling approaches that incorporate information on known pharmacological parameters, the extent of protocol comp liance for individual subjects or other biologically based data may provide valuable in sights"}

The assumptions underlying such models should always be clearly identified, and the limitations of any conclusions should be carefully described. 5.6 Adjustment of Significance and Confidence Levels When multiplicity is present, the usual freque ntist approach to the analysis of clinical trial data may necessitate an adjustment to the type I error. Multiplicity may arise, for example, from multiple primary variables (see Section 2.2.2), multiple comparisons of treatments, repeated evaluation over time and/or interim analyses (see Section 4.5). Methods to avoid or re duce multiplicity are sometimes preferable when available, such as the identification of the key primary variable (multiple variables), the choice of a critical treatment contrast (multiple comparisons), the use of a summary measure such as ‘area under the curve’ (repeated measures). In confirmatory analyses, any aspects of multiplicity which remain after steps of this kind have been taken should be identified in the protocol; adjustment should always be considered and the details of any adjustment procedure or an explanation of why adjustment is not thought to be necessary should be set out in the analysis plan. 5.7 Subgroups, Interactions and Covariates The primary variable(s) is often systematica lly related to other influences apart from treatment. For example, there may be relation ships to covariates such as age and sex, or there may be differences between specif ic subgroups of subjects such as those treated at the different centres of a multicentre trial. In some instances an adjustment for the influence of covariates or for subgroup effects is an integral part of the planned analysis and hence should be set out in the protocol. Pre-trial deliberations should identify those covariates and factors expected to have an important influence on the primary variable( s), and should consider how to account for these in the analysis in order to improv e precision and to compensate for any lack of balance between treatment groups. If one or more factors are used to stratify the design, it is appropriate to account for those factors in the analysis. When the potential value of an adjustment is in doubt, it is often advisable to nominate the unadjusted analysis as the one for primary attention, the adjusted analysis being supportive. Special attention should be paid to centre effects and to the role of 26 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials baseline measurements of the primary variable. It is not advisable to adjust the main analyses for covariates measured after r andomisation because they may be affected by the treatments. The treatment effect itself may also vary with subgroup or covariate - for example, the effect may decrease with age or may be larger in a particular diagnostic category of subjects. In some cases such interactions are anticipated or are of particular prior interest (e.g. geriatrics), and hence a subgroup analysis, or a statistical model including interactions, is part of the planne d confirmatory analysis. In most cases, however, subgroup or interaction analyses are exploratory and should be clearly identified as such; they should explore the uniformity of any treatment effects found overall. In general, such analyses should proceed first through the addition of interaction terms to the statistical model in question, complemented by additional exploratory analysis within relevant subgroups of subjects, or within strata defined by the covariates. When exploratory, these anal yses should be interpreted cautiously; any conclusion of treatment efficacy (or lack thereof) or safety based solely on exploratory subgroup analyses are unlikely to be accepted. 5.8 Integrity of Data and Computer Software Validity The credibility of the numerical results of the analysis depends on the quality and validity of the methods and software (both internally and externally written) used both for data management (data entry, storag e, verification, correction and retrieval) and also for processing the data statistically. Data management activities should therefore be based on thorough and effe ctive standard operating procedures. The computer software used for data management and statistical analysis should be reliable, and documentation of appropriate software testing procedures should be available. VI. EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY 6.1 Scope of Evaluation In all clinical trials evaluation of safety and tolerability (see Glossary) constitutes an important element.

In early phases this ev aluation is mostly of an exploratory nature, and is only sensitive to frank expressions of toxicity, whereas in later phases the establishment of the safety and tolerability profile of a drug can be characterised more fully in larger samples of subjects. Later phase controlled trials represent an important means of exploring in an unbiased manner any new potential adverse effects, even if such trials generally lack power in this respect. Certain trials may be designed with the pu rpose of making specific claims about superiority or equivalence with regard to safety and tolerability compared to another drug or to another dose of the investigatio nal drug. Such specific claims should be supported by relevant evidence from confirmatory trials, similar to that necessary for corresponding efficacy claims. 6.2 Choice of Variables and Data Collection In any clinical trial the methods and measurements chosen to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a drug will depend on a num ber of factors, including knowledge of the adverse effects of closely related drugs, information from non-clinical and earlier clinical trials and possible consequences of the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic properties of the particular drug, the mode of administration, the type of subjects to be studied, and the duration of the trial . Laboratory tests concerning clinical chemistry and haematology, vital signs, and clinical adverse events (diseases, signs and symptoms) usually form the main body of the safety and tolerability data. The 27 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials occurrence of serious adverse events and treatment discontinuations due to adverse events are particularly important to register (see ICH E2A and ICH E3). Furthermore, it is recommended that a consistent methodology be used for the data collection and evaluation throughout a clinical trial program in order to facilitate the combining of data from different trials. Th e use of a common adverse event dictionary is particularly important. This dictionary has a structure which gives the possibility to summarise the adverse event data on th ree different levels; system-organ class, preferred term or included term (see Glossa ry). The preferred term is the level on which adverse events usually are summaris ed, and preferred terms belonging to the same system-organ class could then be brought together in the descriptive presentation of data (see ICH M1). 6.3 Set of Subjects to be Eval uated and Presentation of Data For the overall safety and tolerability a ssessment, the set of subjects to be summarised is usually defined as those subjects who received at least one dose of the investigational drug. Safety and tolerability variables should be collected as comprehensively as possible from these subj ects, including type of adverse event, severity, onset and duration (see ICH E2 B). Additional safety and tolerability evaluations may be needed in specific subpopulations, such as females, the elderly (see ICH E7), the severely ill, or thos e who have a common concomitant treatment. These evaluations may need to address more specific issues (see ICH E3). All safety and tolerability variables will need attention during evaluation, and the broad approach should be indicated in the protocol. All adverse events should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be related to treatment. All available data in the study population should be accounted for in the evaluation. Definitions of measurement units and reference ranges of l aboratory variables should be made with care; if different units or different referenc e ranges appear in the same trial (e.g. if more than one laboratory is involved), then measurements should be appropriately standardised to allow a unified evaluation. Us e of a toxicity grading scale should be prespecified and justified. The incidence of a certain adverse event is usually expressed in the form of a proportion relating number of subjects experiencing events to number of subjects at risk. However, it is not always self-evident how to a ssess incidence. For example, depending on the situation the number of expo sed subjects or the extent of exposure (in person-years) could be considered for the denominator. Whether the purpose of the calculation is to estimate a risk or to ma ke a comparison between treatment groups it is important that the definition is given in the protocol. This is especially important if long-term treatment is planned and a s ubstantial proportion of treatment withdrawals or deaths are expected. For su ch situations survival analysis methods should be considered and cumulative advers e event rates calculated in order to avoid the risk of underestimation. In situations when there is a substantia l background noise of signs and symptoms (e.g. in psychiatric trials) one should cons ider ways of accounting for this in the estimation of risk for different adverse even ts.

Other methods to reduce the effect of the background noise may also be appropriate such as ignoring adverse events of mild severity or requiring that an event should have been observed at repeated visits to qualify for inclusion in the numerator. Such methods should be explained and justified in the protocol. 28 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials 6.4 Statistical Evaluation The investigation of safety and tolerability is a multidimensional problem. Although some specific adverse effects can usually be anticipated and specifically monitored for any drug, the range of possible adverse effects is very large, and new and unforeseeable effects are always possible. Further, an adverse event experienced after a protocol violation, such as use of an excluded medication, may introduce a bias. This background underlies the statistical difficu lties associated with the analytical evaluation of safety and tolerability of drugs, and means that conclusive information from confirmatory clinical trials is the exception rather than the rule. In most trials the safety and tolerability im plications are best addressed by applying descriptive statistical methods to the data, supplemented by calculation of confidence intervals wherever this aids interpretati on. It is also valuable to make use of graphical presentations in which patterns of adverse events are displayed both within treatment groups and within subjects. The calculation of p-values is sometimes useful either as an aid to evaluating a specific difference of interest, or as a 'f lagging' device applied to a large number of safety and tolerability variables to highlight differences worth further attention. This is particularly useful for laboratory da ta, which otherwise can be difficult to summarise appropriately. It is recommended that laboratory data be subjected to both a quantitative analysis, e.g. evaluation of treatment means, and a qualitative analysis where counting of numbers above or below certain thresholds are calculated. If hypothesis tests are used, statistical adjustments for multiplicity to quantify the type I error are appropriate, but the type II error is usually of more concern. Care should be taken when interpreting putative statistically significant findings when there is no multiplicity adjustment. In the majority of trials investigators ar e seeking to establish that there are no clinically unacceptable differences in safety and tolerability compared with either a comparator drug or a placebo. As is th e case for non-inferiority or equivalence evaluation of efficacy the use of confidence intervals is preferred to hypothesis testing in this situation. In this way, the considerable imprecision often arising from low frequencies of occurrence is clearly demonstrated. 6.5 Integrated Summary The safety and tolerability properties of a drug are commonly summarised across trials continuously during an investigational product’s development and in particular at the time of a marketing application. The usefulness of this summary, however, is dependent on adequate and well-controlled individual trials with high data quality. The overall usefulness of a drug is alwa ys a question of balance between risk and benefit and in a single trial such a perspecti ve could also be considered, even if the assessment of risk/benefit usually is perfor med in the summary of the entire clinical trial program. (See section 7.2.2) For more details on the reporting of safety and tolerability, see Chapter 12 of ICH E3. VII. REPORTING 7.1 Evaluation and Reporting As stated in the Introduction, the structure and content of clinical study reports is the subject of ICH E3. That ICH guidance fully covers the reporting of statistical work, appropriately integrated with clinical and other material. The current section is therefore relatively brief. 29 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials During the planning phase of a trial the principal features of the analysis should have been specified in the protocol as described in Section 5. When the conduct of the trial is over and the data are assembled and av ailable for preliminary inspection, it is valuable to carry out the blind review of the planned analysis also described in Section 5. This pre-analysis review, blin ded to treatment, should cover decisions concerning, for example, the exclusion of subjects or data from the analysis sets; possible transformations may also be chec ked, and outliers defined; important covariates identified in other recent resea rch may be added to the model; the use of parametric or non-parametric methods may be reconsidered. Decisions made at this time should be described in the report, and should be distinguished from those made after the statistician has had access to the treatment codes, as"}

Decisions made at this time should be described in the report, and should be distinguished from those made after the statistician has had access to the treatment codes, as blind decisions will generally introduce less potential for bias. Statisticians or other staff involved in unblinded interim analysis should not participa te in the blind review or in making modifications to the statistical analysis plan. When the blinding is compromised by the possibility that treatment induced effects may be apparent in the data, special care will be needed for the blind review. Many of the more detailed aspects of presentation and tabulation should be finalised at or about the time of the blind review so that by the time of the actual analysis full plans exist for all its aspects includin g subject selection, data selection and modification, data summary and tabulation, estimation and hypothesis testing. Once data validation is complete, the analysis sh ould proceed according to the pre-defined plans; the more these plans are adhered to, the greater the credibility of the results. Particular attention should be paid to any differences between the planned analysis and the actual analysis as described in the protocol, protocol amendments or the updated statistical analysis plan based on a blind review of data. A careful explanation should be provided for deviations from the planned analysis. All subjects who entered the trial should be accounted for in the report, whether or not they are included in the analysis. All reasons for exclusion from analysis should be documented; for any subject included in the full analysis set but not in the per protocol set, the reasons for exclusion fr om the latter should also be documented. Similarly, for all subjects included in an analysis set, the measurements of all important variables should be accounted for at all relevant time-points. The effect of all losses of subjects or da ta, withdrawals from treatment and major protocol violations on the main analyses of the primary variable(s) should be considered carefully. Subjects lost to follo w up, withdrawn from treatment, or with a severe protocol violation should be iden tified, and a descriptive analysis of them provided, including the reasons for their lo ss and its relationship to treatment and outcome. Descriptive statistics form an indispens able part of reports. Suitable tables and/or graphical presentations should illustrate clearly the important features of the primary and secondary variables and of ke y prognostic and demographic variables. The results of the main analyses relating to the objectives of the trial should be the subject of particularly careful descriptive pr esentation. When reporting the results of significance tests, precise p-values (e.g .'p=0.034') should be reported rather than making exclusive reference to critical values. Although the primary goal of the analysis of a clinical trial should be to answer the questions posed by its main objectives, new questions based on the observed data may well emerge during the unblinded analysis. Additional and perhaps complex statistical analysis may be the consequence. This additional work should be strictly distinguished in the report from work which was planned in the protocol. 30 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials The play of chance may lead to unforeseen imbalances between the treatment groups in terms of baseline measurements not pre-defined as covariates in the planned analysis but having some prognostic importanc e nevertheless. This is best dealt with by showing that an additional analysis which accounts for these imbalances reaches essentially the same conclusions as the planned analysis. If this is not the case, the effect of the imbalances on the conclusions should be discussed. In general, sparing use should be made of unplanned analyses. Such analyses are often carried out when it is thought that the treatment effect may vary according to some other factor or factors. An attempt may then be made to identify subgroups of subjects for whom the effect is particularly beneficial. The potential dangers of over- interpretation of unplanned subgroup analys es are well known (see also Section 5.7), and should be carefully avoided. Although similar problems of interpretation arise if a treatment appears to have no benefit, or an adverse effect, in a subgroup of subjects, such possibilities should be properly assessed and should therefore be reported. Finally statistical judgement should be brought to bear on the analysis, interpretation and presentation of the results of a clinical trial. To this end the trial statistician should be a member of the team responsible for the clinical study report, and should approve the clinical report. 7.2 Summarising the Clinical Database An overall summary and synthesis of the evid ence on safety and efficacy from all the reported clinical trials is required for a"}

Finally statistical judgement should be brought to bear on the analysis, interpretation and presentation of the results of a clinical trial. To this end the trial statistician should be a member of the team responsible for the clinical study report, and should approve the clinical report. 7.2 Summarising the Clinical Database An overall summary and synthesis of the evid ence on safety and efficacy from all the reported clinical trials is required for a ma rketing application (Expert report in EU, integrated summary reports in USA, Gaiyo in Japan). This may be accompanied, when appropriate, by a statistical combination of results. Within the summary a number of areas of specific statistical interest arise: describing the demography and clinical features of th e population treated during the course of the clinical trial programme; addressing th e key questions of efficacy by considering the results of the relevant (usually con trolled) trials and highlighting the degree to which they reinforce or contradict each ot her; summarising the safety information available from the combined database of all the trials whose results contribute to the marketing application and identifying potentia l safety issues. During the design of a clinical programme careful attention should be paid to the uniform definition and collection of measurements which will facilitate subsequent interpretation of the series of trials, particularly if they are lik ely to be combined across trials. A common dictionary for recording the details of medi cation, medical history and adverse events should be selected and used. A common de finition of the primary and secondary variables is nearly always worthwhile, and essential for meta-analysis. The manner of measuring key efficacy variables, the timing of assessments relative to randomisation/entry, the handling of protocol violators and deviators and perhaps the definition of prognostic factors, should a ll be kept compatible unless there are valid reasons not to do so. Any statistical procedures used to combine data across trials should be described in detail. Attention should be paid to the possi bility of bias associated with the selection of trials, to the homogeneity of their re sults, and to the proper modelling of the various sources of variation. The sensitivity of conclusions to the assumptions and selections made should be explored. 7.2.1 Efficacy Data Individual clinical trials should always be large enough to satisfy their objectives. Additional valuable information may also be gained by summarising a series of clinical trials which address essentially id entical key efficacy questions. The main results of such a set of trials should be presented in an identical form to permit 31 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials comparison, usually in tables or graphs which focus on estimates plus confidence limits. The use of meta-analytic techniques to combine these estimates is often a useful addition, because it allows a more precise overall estimate of the size of the treatment effects to be generated, and pr ovides a complete and concise summary of the results of the trials. Under exceptional circumstances a meta analytic approach may also be the most appropriate way, or the only way, of providing sufficient overall evidence of efficacy via an overall hypothesis test. When used for this purpose the meta-analysis should have its own prospectively written protocol. 7.2.2 Safety Data In summarising safety data it is important to examine the safety database thoroughly for any indications of potential toxicity, and to follow up any indications by looking for an associated supportive pattern of observat ions. The combination of the safety data from all human exposure to the drug provid es an important source of information, because its larger sample size provides th e best chance of detecting the rarer adverse events and, perhaps, of estimating their approximate incidence. However, incidence data from this database are difficult to ev aluate because of the lack of a comparator group, and data from comparative trials ar e especially valuable in overcoming this difficulty. The results from trials which use a common comparator (placebo or specific active comparator) should be combined and presented separately for each comparator providing sufficient data. All indications of potential toxicity arising from exploration of the data should be reported. The evaluation of the reality of th ese potential adverse effects should take account of the issue of multiplicity arising from the numerous comparisons made. The evaluation should also make appropriate us e of survival analysis methods to exploit the potential relationship of the incidence of adverse events to duration of exposure and/or follow-up. The risks associated with identified adverse effects should be appropriately quantified to allow a proper assessment of the risk/benefit relationship.

Th e posterior distribution is then used as the basis for statistical inference. Bias (Statistical & Operational) The systematic tendency of any factors asso ciated with the design, conduct, analysis and evaluation of the results of a clinical trial to make the estimate of a treatment effect deviate from its true value. Bias in troduced through deviations in conduct is referred to as 'operational' bi as. The other sources of bias listed above are referred to as 'statistical'. Blind Review The checking and assessment of data during the period of time between trial completion (the last observation on the last subject) and the breaking of the blind, for the purpose of finalising the planned analysis. Content Validity The extent to which a variable (e.g. a rating scale) measures what it is supposed to measure. 32 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Double-Dummy A technique for retaining the blind when ad ministering supplies in a clinical trial, when the two treatments cannot be made identical. Supplies are prepared for Treatment A (active and indistinguishable pl acebo) and for Treatment B (active and indistinguishable placebo). Subjects then take two sets of treatment; either A (active) and B (placebo), or A (placebo) and B (active). Dropout A subject in a clinical trial who for any reas on fails to continue in the trial until the last visit required of him/her by the study protocol. Equivalence Trial A trial with the primary objective of show ing that the response to two or more treatments differs by an amount which is clinically unimportant. This is usually demonstrated by showing that the true treatment difference is likely to lie between a lower and an upper equivalence margin of clinically acceptable differences. Frequentist Methods Statistical methods, such as significance tests and confidence intervals, which can be interpreted in terms of the frequency of certain outcomes occurring in hypothetical repeated realisations of the same experimental situation. Full Analysis Set The set of subjects that is as close as possible to the ideal implied by the intention-to- treat principle. It is derived from the set of all randomised subjects by minimal and justified elimination of subjects. Generalisability, Generalisation The extent to which the findings of a clin ical trial can be reliably extrapolated from the subjects who participated in the trial to a broader patient population and a broader range of clinical settings. Global Assessment Variable A single variable, usually a scale of orde red categorical ratings, which integrates objective variables and the investigator's ov erall impression about the state or change in state of a subject. Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) (Data and Safety Monitoring Board, Monitoring Committee, Data Monitoring Committee) An independent data-monitoring committee that may be established by the sponsor to assess at intervals the progress of a clinical trial, the safety data, and the critical efficacy endpoints, and to recommend to th e sponsor whether to continue, modify, or stop a trial. Intention-To-Treat Principle The principle that asserts that the effect of a treatment policy can be best assessed by evaluating on the basis of the intention to treat a subject (i.e. the planned treatment regimen) rather than the actual treatment gi ven. It has the consequence that subjects allocated to a treatment group should be followed up, assessed and analysed as members of that group irrespective of their compliance to the planned course of treatment. 33 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Interaction (Qualitative & Quantitative) The situation in which a treatment contrast (e.g. difference between investigational product and control) is dependent on ano ther factor (e.g. centre). A quantitative interaction refers to the case where the magnitude of the contrast differs at the different levels of the factor, whereas for a qualitative interaction the direction of the contrast differs for at least one level of the factor. Inter-Rater Reliability The property of yielding equivalent results when used by different raters on different occasions. Intra-Rater Reliability The property of yielding equivalent results when used by the same rater on different occasions. Interim Analysis Any analysis intended to compare treatment arms with respect to efficacy or safety at any time prior to the formal completion of a trial. Meta-Analysis The formal evaluation of the quantitative evid ence from two or more trials bearing on the same question. This most commonly involves the statistical combination of summary statistics from the various trials, but the term is sometimes also used to refer to the combination of the raw data. Multicentre Trial A clinical trial conducted according to a single protocol but at more than one site, and therefore, carried out by more than one investigator. Non-Inferiority Trial A trial with the primary objective of showin g that"}

Multicentre Trial A clinical trial conducted according to a single protocol but at more than one site, and therefore, carried out by more than one investigator. Non-Inferiority Trial A trial with the primary objective of showin g that the response to the investigational product is not clinically inferior to a comparative agent (active or placebo control). Preferred and Included Terms In a hierarchical medical dictionary, for example MedDRA, the included term is the lowest level of dictionary term to which th e investigator description is coded. The preferred term is the level of grouping of included terms typically used in reporting frequency of occurrence. For example, the investigator text “Pain in the left arm” might be coded to the included term “Joint pain”, which is reported at the preferred term level as “Arthralgia”. Per Protocol Set (Valid Cases, Efficacy Sample, Evaluable Subjects Sample) The set of data generated by the subset of subjects who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data wo uld be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment, according to the underlying scie ntific model. Compliance covers such considerations as exposure to treatment, av ailability of measurements and absence of major protocol violations. Safety & Tolerability The safety of a medical product concerns the medical risk to the subject, usually assessed in a clinical trial by laboratory tests (including clinical chemistry and haematology), vital signs, clinical adverse events (diseases, signs and symptoms), and 34 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials other special safety tests (e.g. ECGs, opht halmology). The tolerability of the medical product represents the degree to which ove rt adverse effects can be tolerated by the subject. Statistical Analysis Plan A statistical analysis plan is a document that contains a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the analysis described in the protocol, and includes detailed procedures for executing the statistical analysis of the primary and secondary variables and other data. Superiority Trial A trial with the primary objective of showin g that the response to the investigational product is superior to a comparative agent (active or placebo control). Surrogate Variable A variable that provides an indirect measurem ent of effect in situations where direct measurement of clinical effect is not feasible or practical. Treatment Effect An effect attributed to a treatment in a c linical trial. In most clinical trials the treatment effect of interest is a comparison (or contrast) of two or more treatments. Treatment Emergent An event that emerges during treatment having been absent pre-treatment, or worsens relative to the pre-treatment state. Trial Statistician A statistician who has a combination of ed ucation/training and experience sufficient to implement the principles in this guidance and who is responsible for the statistical aspects of the trial. 35"}

That choice affects the inferences that can be drawn from the trial, the ethical acceptability of the trial, the degree to wh ich bias in conducting and analyzing the study can be minimized, the types of subjects that can be recruited and the pace of recruitment, the kind of endpoints that c an be studied, the public and scientific credibility of the results, the acceptability of the results by regulatory authorities, and many other features of the study, its conduct, and its interpretation. 1.1 General Scheme and Purpose of Guideline The purpose of this guideline is to describe the general principles involved in choosing a control group for clinical trials intended to demonstrate the efficacy of a treatment and to discuss related trial design and conduct issues. This guideline does not address the regulatory requirements in any region, but describes what trials using each design can demonstrate. The general pr inciples described in this guideline are relevant to any controlled trial but the choice of control group is of particularly critical importance to clinical trials carried out during drug development to demonstrate efficacy. The choice of the control group should be considered in the context of available standard therapies, the adequacy of the evidence to support the chosen design, and ethical considerations. This guideline first describes the purpose of the control group and the types of control groups commonly employed to demonstrate efficacy. It then discusses the critical design and interpretation issues associated with the use of an active control trial to demonstrate efficacy by showing non-inferiority or equivalence to the control (Section 1.5). There are circumstances in which a finding of non-inferiority cannot be interpreted as evidence of efficacy. Specific ally, for a finding of non-inferiority to be interpreted as showing efficacy, the trial needs to have had the ability to distinguish effective from less effective or ineffective treatments. The guideline then describes trials using ea ch kind of control group in more detail (see sections 2. - 2.5.7) and considers, for each: Its ability to minimize bias Ethical and practical issues associated with its use Its usefulness and the quality of inference in particular situations Modifications of study design or combinatio ns with other controls that can resolve ethical, practical, or inferential concerns Its overall advantages and disadvantages Several other ICH guidelines are particularly relevant to this guideline: E3: Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports E4: Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration E5: Ethnic Factors E6: Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline E8: General Considerations for Clinical Trials E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 2 Although trials using any of the control groups described and discussed in this guideline may be useful and acceptable in clinical trials that serve as the basis for marketing approval in at least some circu mstances, they are not equally appropriate or useful in every cases. The general approach to selecting the type of control is outlined in Section 3., Figure 1, and Table 1. Although this guideline is focused primarily on clinical trials intended to assess the efficacy of a treatment, many of the cons iderations discussed also apply to the assessment of specific safety hypotheses and to safety or efficacy comparisons of two treatments. 1.2 Purpose of Control Group Control groups have one major purpose: to allow discrimination of patient outcomes (for example, changes in symptoms, signs, or other morbidity) caused by the test treatment from outcomes caused by other factors, such as the natural progression of the disease, observer or patient expectation s, or other treatment. The control group experience tells us what would have happened to patients if they had not received the test treatment or if they had received a different treatment known to be effective. If the course of a disease were uniform in a given patient population, or predictable from patient characteristics such that outcome could be predicted reliably for any given subject or group of subjects, results of treatment could simply be compared with the known outcome without treatment. For example, one could assume that pain would have persisted for a defined time, blood pressure would not have changed, depression would have lasted for a define d time, tumors would have progressed, or the mortality after an acute infarction would have been the same as previously seen. In unusual cases, the course of illness is in fact predictable in a defined population and it may be possible to use a similar gr oup of patients previously studied as a historical control (see section 1.3.5). In most situations, however, a concurrent control group is needed"}

If the course of a disease were uniform in a given patient population, or predictable from patient characteristics such that outcome could be predicted reliably for any given subject or group of subjects, results of treatment could simply be compared with the known outcome without treatment. For example, one could assume that pain would have persisted for a defined time, blood pressure would not have changed, depression would have lasted for a define d time, tumors would have progressed, or the mortality after an acute infarction would have been the same as previously seen. In unusual cases, the course of illness is in fact predictable in a defined population and it may be possible to use a similar gr oup of patients previously studied as a historical control (see section 1.3.5). In most situations, however, a concurrent control group is needed because it is not possible to predict outcome with adequate accuracy or certainty. A concurrent control group is one chosen from the same population as the test group and treated in a defined way as part of the same trial that studies the test treatment, and over the same period of time. The test and control groups should be similar with regard to all baseline and on-treatment variables that could influence outcome, except for the study treatment. Failure to achieve this similarity can introduce a bias into the study. Bias here (and as used in IC H E9) means the systematic tendency of any aspects of the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of the results of clinical trials to make the estimate of a treatme nt effect deviate from its true value. Randomization and blinding are the two te chniques usually used to minimize the chance of such bias and to ensure that the test treatment and control groups are similar at the start of the study and are tre ated similarly in the course of the study (see ICH E9). Whether a trial design includes these features is a critical determinant of its quality and persuasiveness. 1.2.1 Randomization Assurance that subject populations are similar in test and control groups is best attained by randomly dividing a single sample population into groups that receive the test or control treatments. Randomizatio n avoids systematic differences between groups with respect to known or unknown baseline variables that could affect outcome. Inability to eliminate systematic differences between treatment groups is a Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 3 major problem of studies without a concurrent randomized control (see external control trials, section 1.3.5). Randomization also provides a sound basis for statistical inference. 1.2.2 Blinding The groups should not only be similar at bas eline, but should be treated and observed similarly during the trial, except for rece iving the test and control drug. Clinical trials are often “double-blind” (or “double-masked”), meaning that both subjects and investigators, as well as sponsor or investigator staff involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of subjects, are unaware of each subject's assigned treatment. Blinding is intended to minimize the potential biases resulting from differences in management, treatment, or assessment of pati ents, or interpretation of results that could arise as a result of subject or investig ator knowledge of the assigned treatment. For example: • Subjects on active drug might report more favorable outcomes because they expect a benefit or might be more likely to stay in a study if they knew they were on active drug. • Observers might be less likely to identify and report treatment responses in a no-treatment group or might be more sensitive to a favorable outcome or adverse event in patients receiving active drug. • Knowledge of treatment assignment could affect vigor of attempts to obtain on-study or follow-up data. • Knowledge of treatment assignment co uld affect decisions about whether a subject should remain on treatment or receive concomitant medications or other ancillary therapy. • Knowledge of treatment assignment co uld affect decisions as to whether a given subject's results should be included in an analysis. • Knowledge of treatment assignment could affect choice of statistical analysis. Blinding is intended to ensure that s ubjective assessments and decisions are not affected by knowledge of treatment assignment. 1.3 Types of Controls Control groups in clinical trials can be classified on the basis of two critical attributes: (1) the type of treatment used and (2) the method of determining who will be in the control group. The type of control treatme nt may be any of the following four: (1) placebo, (2) no treatment, (3) different dose or regimen of the study treatment, or (4) a different active treatment. The principal methods of determining who will be in the control group are by randomization or by se lection of a control population separate from the population treated in the trial (external or historical control). This document categorizes control groups into five types. The first four are concurrently controlled (the control group and test groups are chos en from the same population and treated concurrently), usually with random assignment to treatment; they are distinguished by the type of control treatment (listed abo ve) used. External (historical) control groups, regardless of the comparator treatme nt, are considered together as the fifth type because of serious concerns about the ability of such trials to ensure comparability of test and control groups"}

Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 4 It is increasingly common to carry out studie s that have more than one type of control group. Each type of control group is appropriate in some circumstances, but none is usable or adequate in every situation. The five types of control group are: 1.3.1 Placebo Concurrent Control In a placebo-controlled trial, subjects are rand omly assigned to a test treatment or to an identical-appearing treatment that does not contain the test drug. The treatments may be titrated to effect or tolerance, or ma y be given at one or more fixed doses. Such trials are almost always double-blind. The name of the control suggests that its purpose is to control for \"placebo\" effect (improvement in a subject resulting from thinking that he or she is taking a drug), but that is not its only or major benefit. Rather, the placebo control design, by a llowing blinding and randomization and including a group that receives an inert treatment, controls for all potential influences on the actual or apparent course of the disease other than those arising from the pharmacologic action of the test drug. These influences include spontaneous change (natural history of the disease and regression to the mean), subject or investigator expectations, the effect of being in a trial, use of other therapy, and subjective elements of diagnosis or assessment. Placebo-controlled trials seek to show a difference between treatments when they are studying effectiveness, but may also seek to show lack of difference (of specified size) in evaluating a safety measurement. In that case, the question of whether the trial could have shown such a difference if there had been one is critical (see section 1.5). The use of a placebo control group does not imply that the control group is untreated. In many placebo-controlled trials, the new treatment and placebo are each added to a common standard therapy (so called add-on studies, see section 2.1.5.2.1). 1.3.2 No-treatment Concurrent Control In a no treatment-controlled trial, subjects are randomly assigned to test treatment or to no (i.e., absence of) study treatment. The principal difference between this design and a placebo-controlled trial is that s ubjects and investigators are not blind to treatment assignment. Because of the advantages of double-blind designs, this design is likely to be needed and suitable only wh en it is difficult or impossible to double- blind (e.g., treatments with easily recogn ized toxicity) and only when there is reasonable confidence that study endpoints are objective and that the results of the trial are unlikely to be influenced by the factors listed in section 1.2.2. Note that it is often possible to have a blinded evaluator ca rry out endpoint assessment, even if the overall trial is not double-blind. This is a valuable approach and should always be considered in trials that cannot be blinded, but it does not solve the other problems associated with knowing the treatment assignment (see section 1.2.2). 1.3.3 Dose-response Concurrent Control In a randomized, fixed-dose, dose-response trial, subjects are randomized to one of several fixed-dose groups. Subjects may eith er be placed on their fixed dose initially or be raised to that dose gradually, but the intended comparison is between the groups on their final dose. Dose-response trials are usually double-blind. They may include a placebo (zero dose) and/or active control. In a concentration-controlled trial, treatment groups are titrated to several fi xed-concentration windows; this type of trial is conceptually similar to a fixed- dose, dose-response trial. In a regimen- Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 5 controlled trial subjects are randomized to two or more regimens of the study drug (e.g., once vs twice daily, 3 days vs 7 days). 1.3.4 Active (Positive) Concurrent Control In an active control (or positive control) tri al, subjects are randomly assigned to the test treatment or to an active control treat ment. Such trials are usually double-blind, but this is not always possible; many oncology trials, for example, are considered difficult or impossible to blind because of different regimens, different routes of administration (see section 1.3.2), and diffe rent toxicities. Acti ve control trials can have two distinct objectives with respect to sh owing efficacy: (1) to show efficacy of the test treatment by showing it is as good as a known effective treatment or (2) to show efficacy by showing superiority of the"}

In a regimen- Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 5 controlled trial subjects are randomized to two or more regimens of the study drug (e.g., once vs twice daily, 3 days vs 7 days). 1.3.4 Active (Positive) Concurrent Control In an active control (or positive control) tri al, subjects are randomly assigned to the test treatment or to an active control treat ment. Such trials are usually double-blind, but this is not always possible; many oncology trials, for example, are considered difficult or impossible to blind because of different regimens, different routes of administration (see section 1.3.2), and diffe rent toxicities. Acti ve control trials can have two distinct objectives with respect to sh owing efficacy: (1) to show efficacy of the test treatment by showing it is as good as a known effective treatment or (2) to show efficacy by showing superiority of the te st treatment to the active control. They may also be used with the primary objective of comparing the efficacy and/or safety of the two treatments (see section 1.4). Whether the purpose of the trial is to show efficacy of the new treatment or to comp are two treatments, the question of whether the trial would be capable of distinguishing effective from less effective or ineffective treatments is critical (see section 1.5). 1.3.5 External Control (Including Historical Control) An externally controlled trial compares a group of subjects receiving the test treatment with a group of patients external to the study, rather than to an internal control group consisting of patients from the same population assigned to a different treatment. The external control can be a gr oup of patients treated at an earlier time (historical control) or a group treated duri ng the same time period but in another setting. The external control may be define d (a specific group of patients) or non- defined (a comparator group based on genera l medical knowledge of outcome). Use of this latter comparator is particularly treac herous (such trials are usually considered uncontrolled) because general impressions are so often inaccurate. So-called baseline- controlled studies, in which subjects' status on therapy is compared with status before therapy (e.g., blood pressure, tumor size), have no internal control and are thus uncontrolled or externally controlled (see section 2.5). 1.3.6 Multiple Control Groups As will be described further below (see section 1.5.1), it is often possible and advantageous to use more than one kind of co ntrol in a single study, e.g., use of both an active control and placebo. Similarly, tri als can use several doses of test drug and several doses of an active control, with or wi thout placebo. This design may be useful for active drug comparisons where the rela tive potency of the two drugs is not well established, or where the purpose of the trial is to establish relative potency. 1.4 Purposes of Clinical Trials and Related Issues Two purposes of clinical trials should be distinguished: (1) assessment of the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment and (2) assessment of the relative (comparative) efficacy, safety, risk/benefit relationship or utility of two treatments. 1.4.1 Evidence of Efficacy A trial using any of the control types may de monstrate efficacy of the test treatment by showing that it is superior to the con trol (placebo, no treatment, low dose of test drug, active drug). An active control trial may, in addition, demonstrate efficacy in some cases by showing the new treatment to be similar in efficacy to a known effective Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 6 treatment. This similarity establishes the efficacy of the test treatment, however, only if it can be assumed that the active control was effective under the conditions of the trial, as two treatments would also look similar if neither were effective in the trial (see section 1.5). Clinical trials designed to de monstrate efficacy of a new drug by showing that it is similar in efficacy to a standard agent have been called \"equivalence\" trials. Most of these are actually non-inferiority trials, attempting to show that the new drug is not less effective than the control by more t han a defined amount, generally called the margin. 1.4.2 Comparative Efficacy and Safety In some cases, the focus of the trial is on the comparison of one treatment with another treatment, not the efficacy of the test drug per se. Depending on the therapeutic area, these trials may be seen as providing information that is important for relative risk/benefit assessment. The a ctive comparator(s) should be acceptable to the region for which the data are intended . It is not necessa ry to demonstrate superiority to the active comparator, and, de pending on the situation, it may not be necessary to show non-inferiority. For ex ample, a less effective treatment could have safety advantages and thus be considered useful. Even though the primary focus of such a trial is the comparison of treatments, rather than demonstration of efficacy, the cautions described for conducting and interpreting non-inferiority trials need to be taken into account (see section 1.5). Specifically, the ability of the comparative trial to detect a difference between treatments when one exists needs to be established because a trial incapable of distinguishing between treatments that are in fact different cannot provide useful comparative information. 1.4.3 Fairness of Comparisons For the comparative trial to"}

Specifically, the ability of the comparative trial to detect a difference between treatments when one exists needs to be established because a trial incapable of distinguishing between treatments that are in fact different cannot provide useful comparative information. 1.4.3 Fairness of Comparisons For the comparative trial to be informative concerning relative safety and/or efficacy, the trial needs to be fair; i.e., the conditions of the trial should not inappropriately favor one treatment over the other. In pr actice, an active control equivalence or non- inferiority trial offered as evidence of effi cacy also almost always needs to provide a fair effectiveness comparison with the con trol, because any doubt as to whether the control in the study had its usual effect wo uld undermine assurance that the trial had assay sensitivity (see section 1.5). Among as pects of trial design that could unfairly favor one treatment are choice of dose or patient population and selection and timing of endpoints. 1.4.3.1 Dose In comparing the test drug with an acti ve control, it is important to choose an appropriate dose and dose regimen of the control and test drugs. In examining the results of a comparison of two treat ments, it is important to consider whether an apparently less effective treatme nt has been used at too low a dose or whether the apparently less well tole rated treatment has been used at too high a dose. In some cases, to show superior efficacy or safety convincingly it will be necessary to study several doses of the control and perhaps several doses of the test treatment. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 7 1.4.3.2 Patient Population Selection of subjects for an active control trial can affect outcome; the population studied should be carefully considered in evaluating what the trial has shown. For example, if many subjects in a trial have previously failed to respond to the control treatment, there would be a bias in favor of the new treatment. The results of such a trial could not be generalized to the entire population of previously untreated pati ents. A finding of superiority of the new treatment, however, still would be ev idence of the efficacy of the new treatment in the population studied. In fact, a trial of a new treatment in apparent nonresponders to another treatment, in which the nonresponders are randomized to either the new or failed treatment (so long as this does not place the patients at risk), can provide a demonstration of the value of the new treatment in such nonresponders, a clinically valuable observation. Similarly, it is sometimes possible to identify patient subsets more or less likely to have a favorable response or to have an adverse response to a particular drug. For example, blacks usually respond poorly to the blood pressure effects of beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, so that a comparison of a new antihypertensive with these drugs in these patients would tend to show superiority of the new drug. It would not be appropriate to conclude that the new drug is generally superior. Again, however, a planned trial in a subgroup, with recognition of its limitations and of what conclusion can properly be drawn, could be informative. 1.4.3.3 Selection and Timing of Endpoints When two treatments are used for the same disease or condition, they may differentially affect various outcomes of in terest in that disease, particularly if they represent different classes or modalities of treatment. Therefore, when comparing them in a clinical trial, the choice and timing of endpoints may favor one treatment or the other. For ex ample, thrombolytics in patients with acute myocardial infarction can reduce mortality but increase hemorrhagic stroke risk. If a new, more pharma cologically active, thrombolytic were compared with an older thrombolytic, th e more active treatment might look better if the endpoint were mortality, but worse if the endpoint were a composite of mortality and disabling stroke. Similarly, in comparing two analgesics in the management of dental pain, assigning a particularly heavy weight to pain at early time points wo uld favor the drug with more rapid onset of effect, while assigning more weight to later time points would favor a drug with a longer duration of effect. 1.5 Assay Sensitivity Assay sensitivity is a property of a clinical trial defined as the ability to distinguish an effective treatment from a less effective or ineffective treatment. Assay sensitivity is important in any trial but has different implications for trials intended to show differences between treatments (superiority trials) and trials intended to show non- inferiority. If a trial intended to demonstra te efficacy by showing superiority of a test treatment to control lacks assay sensitivity, it will fail to show that the test treatment is superior and will"}

Assay sensitivity is important in any trial but has different implications for trials intended to show differences between treatments (superiority trials) and trials intended to show non- inferiority. If a trial intended to demonstra te efficacy by showing superiority of a test treatment to control lacks assay sensitivity, it will fail to show that the test treatment is superior and will fail to lead to a conclusion of efficacy. In contrast, if a trial is intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing a test treatment to be non-inferior to an Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 8 active control, but lacks assay sensitivity, the trial may find an ineffective treatment to be non-inferior and could lead to an erroneous conclusion of efficacy. When two treatments within a trial are sh own to have different efficacy (i.e., when one treatment is superior), that finding it self demonstrates that the trial had assay sensitivity. In contrast, a successful non- inferiority trial (i.e., one that has shown non-inferiority), or an unsuccessful superior ity trial, generally does not contain such direct evidence of assay sensitivity. 1.5.1 Assay Sensitivity in Non-inferiority or Equivalence Trials The presence of assay sensitivity in a non-inferiority or equivalence trial may be deduced from two determinations: 1) Historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects , i.e., that similarly designed trials in the past regularly distinguished effe ctive treatments from less effective or ineffective treatments and 2) Appropriate trial conduct , i.e., that the conduct of the trial did not undermine its ability to distinguish effective treatment s from less effective or ineffective treatments. Historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects can, and should, be evaluated before beginning a non-inferiority trial. Specifica lly, it should be determined that, in the specific therapeutic area under study, ap propriately designed and conducted trials that used a specific active treatment, or other treatments with similar effects, reliably showed an effect. Optimally, this is de monstrated by finding that the active treatment intended for use as the active control was reliably found superior to placebo. If this is the case, there is historic al evidence of sensitivity to drug effects for similarly designed active control trials (see section 1.5.1.1). Appropriateness of trial conduct can only be fully evaluated after the active control non-inferiority trial is completed. Not only should the design of the non-inferiority trial be similar to that of previous trials used to determine historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects (e.g., entry criteri a, allowable concomitant therapy); but, in addition, the actual study population entered, the concomitant therapies actually used, etc., should be assessed to ensure that conduct of the study was, in fact, similar to the previous trials. The trial should also be conducted with high quality (e.g., good compliance, few losses to follow-up). Together with historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects, appropriate trial conduct (se ction 1.5.1.2) provides assurance of assay sensitivity in the new active control trial. The design and conduct of a non-inferiority trial thus involve four critical steps: 1. Determining that historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects exists. Without this determination, demonstration of effica cy from a showing of non-inferiority is not possible and should not be attempted. 2. Designing a trial. Important details of the trial design, e.g., study population, concomitant therapy, endpoints, run-in periods, should adhere closely to the design of the trials used to determine that historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects exists. 3. Setting a margin. An acceptable non-inferiority margin should be defined, taking into account the historical data and relevant clinical and statistical considerations. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 9 4. Conducting the trial. The trial conduct should also adhere closely to that of the historical trials and should be of high quality. 1.5.1.1 Historical Evidence of Sensitivity to Drugs Effects and Choosing the Non-inferiority Margin As noted earlier, most active con trol equivalence trials are really non- inferiority trials intended to establish the efficacy of a new treatment. Analysis of the results of non-inferiority trials is discussed in ICH guidances E9 and E3. Briefly, in such a trial, test and a known effective treatments are compared. Prior to the trial, an equivalence or non-inferiority margin, sometimes called delta, is selected. This margin is the degree of inferiority of the test treatments to the control that the trial will attempt to exclude statistically. If the confidence interval for the difference between the test and control treatments excludes a degree of inferiority of the test treatment as large as, or larger than, the margin, th e test treatment can be declared non- inferior; if the confidence interval includes a difference as large as the margin, the test treatment cannot be declared non-inferior. The margin chosen for a non-inferior ity trial cannot be greater than the smallest effect size that the active drug would be"}

The margin chosen for a non-inferior ity trial cannot be greater than the smallest effect size that the active drug would be reliably expected to have compared with placebo in the setting of the planned trial. If a difference between active control and the new drug favors the control by as much as or more than this margin, the new drug might have no effect at all. Identification of the smallest effect size that the active drug would be reliably expected to have is only possible when there is historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects and, indeed, identification of the margin is based upon that evidence. The margin generally is identified based on past experience in placebo- controlled trials of adequate design under conditions similar to those planned for the new trial, but could also be supporte d by dose response or active control superiority studies. Regardless of the control groups used in those earlier studies, the value of interest in determining the margin is the measure of superiority of the active treatment to its control, not uncontrolled measures such as change from baseline. Note that exactly how to calculate the margin is not described in this document, and ther e is little published experience on how to do this. The determination of the margin in a non-inferiority trial is based on both statistical reasoning and clinical judgment, should reflect uncertainties in the evidence on which the choice is based, and should be suitably conservative. If this is done properly, a finding that th e confidence interval for the difference between new drug and the active control excludes a suitably chosen margin provides assurance that the test drug has an effect greater than zero. In practice, the non-inferiority margin chosen usually will be smaller than that suggested by the smallest expected effect si ze of the active control because of interest in ensuring that some clinically acceptable effect size (or fraction of the control drug effect) was maintained. For example, it would not generally be considered sufficient in a mortality no n-inferiority study to ensure that the test treatment had an effect greater than zero; retention of some substantial fraction of the mortality effect of the co ntrol would usually be sought. This would also be true in a trial whose primary focus is the relative effectiveness of a test drug and active control (see secti on 1.4.2), where it would be usual to Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 10 seek assurance that the test and control drug were quite similar, not simply that the new drug had any effect at all. The fact that the choice of the margin to be excluded is based on historical evidence gives the non-inferiority trial an element in common with a historically controlled (externally contro lled) trial. The non-inferiority trial design is appropriate and reliable only when the historical estimate of drug effect size can be well suppo rted by reference to the results of previous studies of the control drug. These studies should lead to the conclusion that the active control can consistently be distinguished from placebo in appropriately sized trials of design similar to the proposed trial and should identify an effect size that represents the smallest effect that the control can reliably be expected to have. If placebo-controlled trials of a design similar to the one proposed more than occasionally show no difference between the proposed active control and placebo, and this cannot be explained by some characteristic of the study, only superiority of the test drug would be interpretable. Whether there is historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects in any given case is to some degree a matter of judgment. In some cases sensitivity to drug effects is clear from the consistency of results of prior placebo-controlled trials or is obvious because the outcome of treated and untreated disease is very different. For example, in many infecti ous diseases cure rates on effective treatment far exceed the spontaneous cure rates over the course of a short- term study. There are many conditions, however, in which drugs considered effective cannot regularly be shown superior to placebo in well-controlled trials; and one therefore cannot reliably determine a minimum effect the drug will have in the setting of a specific trial. Such conditions tend to include those in which there is substantial improvem ent and variability in placebo groups, and/or in which the effects of therapy are small or variable, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, angina, symptomatic congestive heart failure, seasonal allergies, and symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease. In all these cases, there is no doubt t hat"}

In all these cases, there is no doubt t hat the standard treatments are effective because there are many well-controlled tri als of each of these drugs that have shown an effect. Based on available expe rience, however, it would be difficult to describe trial conditions in which the drug would reliably have at least a minimum effect (i.e., conditions in wh ich there is historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects) and that, ther efore, could be used to identify an appropriate margin. In some cases, the experience on which the historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects is based may be of questionable relevance, e.g., if standards of treatment and diagnosis have changed substantially over time (for an example, see section 2.1.7.1). If someone proposing to use an active-control or non-inferiority design cannot provide sufficient support for historical evidence of the sensitivity to drug effects of the study with the chosen non-inferiority margin, a finding of non-inferiority cannot be considered informative with respect to efficacy. As noted, a determination re garding historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects applies only to trials of a spec ific design. For a planned non-inferiority trial to be similarly sensitive to drug effects, it is essential that the trial have critical design characteristics similar to those of the historical trials. These design characteristics include, for example, the entry criteria (severity of Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 11 medical condition, concomitant illness, me thod of diagnosis), dose and regimen of control drug, concomitant treatme nts used, the endpoint measured and timing of assessments, and the use of a washout period to exclude selected patients. When differences in study design characteristics are unavoidable or desirable (e.g., because of technological or therapeutic advances), the implications of any differences for the determination of the presence of historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects and for choice of margin should be carefully considered. 1.5.1.2 Appropriate Trial Conduct Even where there is historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects and the new study is similar in design to the past studies, assay sensitivity can be undermined by the actual conduct of the trial. To ensure assay sensitivity of a trial, its conduct should be of high quality and the patients actually enrolled, the treatments (other than the test treatment) actually given, and the assessments actually made should be similar to those of the trials on which the determination of historical sensitivity to drug effects was based. There are many factors in the conduct of a trial that can reduce the observed difference between an effective treatmen t and a less effective or ineffective treatment and therefore may reduce a trial’s assay sensitivity, such as: 1. Poor compliance with therapy 2. Poor responsiveness of the enrolled study population to drug effects 3. Use of concomitant non-protocol medication or other treatment that interferes with the test drug or that reduces the extent of the potential response 4. An enrolled population that tends to improve spontaneously, leaving no room for further drug-induced improvement 5. Poorly applied diagnostic criteria (p atients lacking the disease to be studied) 6. Biased assessment of endpoint because of knowledge that all patients are receiving a potentially active drug, e.g ., a tendency to read blood pressure responses as normalized, potentially reducing the difference between test drug and control Clinical researchers and trial sponsors intend to perform high-quality trials, and the availability of the Good Clin ical Practice guidance (ICH E6) will continue to enhance trial quality. Noneth eless, it should be appreciated that in trials intended to show a differenc e between treatments there is a strong imperative to use a good trial design and minimize trial errors because many trial imperfections increase the likelihood of failing to show a difference between treatments when one exists. In placebo-controlled trials many efforts are made to improve compliance and in crease the likelihood that the patient population will be responsive to drug effects to ensure that an effective treatment will be distinguished from plac ebo. Nonetheless, in many clinical settings, despite the strong stimulus and extensive efforts to ensure trial excellence and assay sensitivity, clin ical trials are often unable to reliably distinguish effective drugs from placebo. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 12 In contrast, in trials intended to show that there is not a difference of a particular size (non-inferiority) between two treatments, there may be a much weaker stimulus to engage in many of these efforts to ensure study quality that will help ensure that differences"}

The kinds of trial error that diminish observed differences between treatments (e.g., poor compliance, high placebo response, certain concomitant treatment, misclassification of outcomes) are of particular concern with respect to preservation of assay sensitivity. Ho wever, when it is believed that the new drug is actually superior to the contro l, there will be a strong stimulus to conduct a high quality trial so that the no n-inferiority margin is more likely to be excluded. It should also be note d that some kinds of trial errors can increase variance, which would decrease the likelihood of showing non- inferiority by widening the confidence interval, so that a difference between treatment and control greater than the margin could not be excluded. There would therefore be a strong stimulus in non-inferiority trials to reduce such sources of variance as poor measurement technique. As noted, to determine that a non-in feriority trial had appropriate trial conduct, its conduct should be reviewed not only for the presence of factors that might obscure differences between treatme nts but also for factors that might make the trial different from the trials that provided the basis for determining the non-inferiority margin. In particular, it should be determined whether any observed differences in the populations enrolled, the use of concomitant therapies, compliance with therapy, and the extent of, and reasons for, dropping out could adversely affect assay sensitivity. Even when the design and conduct of a trial appear to have been quite similar to those of the trials providing the basis for determining the non-inferiority margin, outcomes with the active control treatment that are vi sibly atypical (e.g., cure rate in an antibiotic trial that is unusually high or low) can indicate that important differences existed. 1.5.2 Assay Sensitivity in Trials Intended to Demonstrate Superiority The question of assay sensitivity, although particularly critical in non-inferiority trials, actually arises in any trial that fails to detect a difference between treatments, including a placebo-controlled trial and a dose-response trial. If a treatment fails to show superiority to placebo, for example, it means either that the treatment was ineffective or that the study as designed and conducted was not capable of distinguishing an effective treatment from placebo. A useful approach to the assessment of assay sensitivity in active control trials and in placebo-controlled trials is the three-arm trial, including both placebo and a known active treatment, a trial design with several advantages. Such a trial measures effect size (test drug versus placebo) and allows comparison of test drug and active control in a setting where assay sensitivity is estab lished by the active control versus placebo comparison (see section 2.1.5.1.1). Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 13 2. DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF TYPES OF CONTROL 2.1 Placebo Control 2.1.1 Description (See Section 1.3.1) In a placebo-controlled trial, subjects are a ssigned, almost always by randomization, to either a test treatment or to a placebo. A placebo is a \"dummy\" treatment that appears as identical as possible to the te st treatment with respect to physical characteristics such as color, weight, tast e and smell, but that does not contain the test drug. Some trials may study more than one dose of the test treatment or include both an active control and placebo. In these cases, it may be easier for the investigator to use more than one placebo (\"double-dummy\") than to try to make all treatments look the same. The use of placebo facilitates, and is almost always accompanied by, double-blinding (or double-masking). The difference in outcome between the active treatment and placebo gr oups is the measure of treatment effect under the conditions of the trial. Within this general description there is a wide variety of designs that can be used succe ssfully: parallel or cross-over designs (see ICH E9), single fixed dose or titration in th e active drug group, several fixed doses. Several designs meriting special attention will be described below. Note that not every study that includes a placebo is a pl acebo-controlled study. For example, an active control study could use a placebo fo r each drug (double-dummy) to facilitate blinding; this is still an active control trial , not a placebo-controlled trial. A placebo- controlled trial is one in which treatment with a placebo is compared with treatment with a test drug. It should also be noted that not all placeb os are completely inactive. For example, some vehicle controls used in studies"}

For example, an active control study could use a placebo fo r each drug (double-dummy) to facilitate blinding; this is still an active control trial , not a placebo-controlled trial. A placebo- controlled trial is one in which treatment with a placebo is compared with treatment with a test drug. It should also be noted that not all placeb os are completely inactive. For example, some vehicle controls used in studies of topical skin preparations may have beneficial activity. This does not impair the ability of the design to measure the specific effect of the test agent. Special problems arise when the chosen vehicle control may have harmful effects. In this case a \"no treat ment\" arm would allow the measurement of the total effect of the test agent plus its vehicle. 2.1.2 Ability to Minimize Bias The placebo-controlled trial, using randomization and blinding, generally minimizes subject and investigator bias. Such tri als, however, are not impervious to blind-breaking through recognition of phar macologic effects of one treatment; blinded outcome assessment can enhance bias reduction in such cases. This concern may be particularly relevant in cross-over studies. 2.1.3 Ethical Issues When a new treatment is tested for a cond ition for which no effective treatment is known, there is usually no ethical problem with a study comparing the new treatment to placebo. Use of a placebo control may raise problems of ethics, acceptability, and feasibility, however, when an effective treatment is available for the condition under study in a proposed trial. In cases wher e an available treatment is known to prevent serious harm, such as death or irreversible morbidity in the study population, it is generally inappropriate to use a placebo co ntrol. There are occasional exceptions, however, such as cases in which standard th erapy has toxicity so severe that many patients have refused to receive it. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 14 In other situations, when there is no serious harm, it is generally considered ethical to ask patients to participate in a placebo-co ntrolled trial, even if they may experience discomfort as a result, provided the setting is noncoercive and patients are fully informed about available therapies and the consequences of delaying treatment. Such trials, however, even if ethical, may pose important practical problems. For example, deferred treatment of pain or other symptoms may be unacceptable to patients or physicians and they may not want to participate in a trial that requires this. Whether a particular placebo controlled trial of a new agent will be acceptable to subjects and investigators when there is known effective therapy is a matter of investigator, patient, and institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) judgment, and acceptab ility may differ among ICH regions. Acceptability could depend on the specific design of the trial and the patient population chosen, as will be discussed below (see section 2.1.5). Whether a particular placebo-controlled trial is ethical may, in some cases, depend on what is believed to have been clinically demonstrated and on the particular circumstances of the trial. For example, a sh ort term placebo-controlled trial of a new antihypertensive agent in patients with mild essential hypertension and no end-organ disease might be considered generally accept able, while a longer trial, or one that included sicker patients, probably would not be. It should be emphasized that use of a plac ebo or no-treatment control does not imply that the patient does not get any treatment at all. For example, in an oncology trial, when no active drug is approved, patients in both the placebo or no-treatment group and the test drug group will receive needed palliative treatment, such as analgesics, and best supportive care. Many plac ebo-controlled trials are conducted as add-on trials, where all patients receive a specified standard therapy or therapy left to the choice of the treating physician or institution (see section 2.1.5.2.1). 2.1.4 Usefulness of Placebo-controlled Trials and Validity of Inference in Particular Situations When used to show effectiveness of a treatme nt, the placebo-controlled trial is as free of assumptions and reliance on external (ext ra-study) information as it is possible to be. Most problems in the design or conduct of a trial increase the likelihood of failure to demonstrate a treatment difference (and thereby establish efficacy), so that the trial contains built-in incentives for trial excellence. Even when the primary purpose of a trial is comparison of two active ag ents or assessment of dose-response, the addition of a placebo provides an internal standard that enhances the inferences that can be drawn from the other comparisons. Placebo-controlled trials also provide the maximum ability to distinguish adverse effects caused by a drug from those result ing from underlying disease or intercurrent illness. Note, however, that when used to show similarity of two treatments, for example, to show that a drug does not have a particular adverse effect by showing similar rates of the event"}

Note, however, that when used to show similarity of two treatments, for example, to show that a drug does not have a particular adverse effect by showing similar rates of the event in drug- treated and placebo-treated patients, placebo-controlled trials have the same assa y sensitivity problem as any equivalence or non-inferiority trial (see section 1.5.1). To interpret the result, one must know that if the study drug had caused an adverse ev ent, the event would have been observed. Ordinarily, such a study should include an ac tive control treatment that does cause the adverse event in question, but in some ca ses it may be possible to conclude that a study has assay sensitivity to such an effect by documenting “historical sensitivity to adverse drug effects” for a particular study design. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 15 2.1.5 Modifications of Design and Comb inations with Other Controls That Can Resolve Ethical, Practical, or Inferential Issues It is often possible to address the ethical or practical limitations of placebo-controlled trials by using modified study designs that still retain the inferential advantages of these trials. In addition, placebo-controlle d trials can be made more informative by including additional treatment groups, such as multiple doses of the test agent or a known active control treatment. 2.1.5.1. Additional Control Groups 2.1.5.1.1 Three-arm Trial; Placebo and Active Control As noted in section 1.5.1, three-arm tri als including an active control as well as a placebo-control group can readily assess whether a failure to distinguish test treatment from placebo implies ineffectiveness of the test treatment or is simply the result of a trial that lacked the ability to identify an active drug. The comparison of placebo to standard drug in such a trial provides internal evidence of assay sensitivity. It is po ssible to make the active groups larger than the placebo group to improve the precision of the active drug comparison, if this is considered important. This may also make the trial more acceptable to patients and investigators, as there is less chance of being randomized to placebo. 2.1.5.1.2 Additional Doses Randomization to several fixed doses of the test drug in addition to placebo allows assessment of dose-response and may be particularly useful in a comparative trial to ensure a fair comparison of treatments (see ICH E4: Dose-Response Information to Support Drug Registration). 2.1.5.1.3 Factorial Designs Factorial designs may be used to expl ore several doses of the investigational drug as monotherapy and in combinatio n with several doses of another agent proposed for use in combination with it. A single study of this type can define the properties of a wide array of combinations. Such studies are common in the evaluation of new antihypertensive th erapies, but can be considered in a variety of settings where more than one treatment is used simultaneously. For example, the independent additive effects of aspirin and streptokinase in preventing mortality after a heart attack were shown in such a trial. 2.1.5.2 Other Modifications of Study Design 2.1.5.2.1 Add-on Study, Placebo-controlled; Replacement Study An add-on study is a placebo-controlled trial of a new agent conducted in people also receiving standard treatment. Such studies are particularly important when available treatment is known to decrease mortality or irreversible morbidity, and when a non-inferiority trial with standard treatment as the active control cannot be carried out or would be difficult to interpret (see section 1.5). It is commo n to study anticancer, antiepileptic, and heart failure drugs this way. This design is useful only when standard treatment is not fully effective (which, however, is almost always the case), and it has the advantage of providing ev idence of improved clinical outcomes Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 16 (rather than \"mere\" non-inferiority). Effi cacy is, of course, established by such studies only for the combination treatment, and the dose in a monotherapy situation might be different from the dose found to be effective in combination. In general, this approach is likely to succeed only when the new and standard treatments possess different pharmacolo gic mechanisms, although there are exceptions. For example, combination treatments for people with AIDS may show a beneficial effect of pharmacologically related drugs because of delays in development of resistance. A variation of this design that can sometimes give information on monotherapy, and that is particularly applicable in the setting of chronic disease, is the replacement study, in which the new drug or placebo is added by random assignment to conventional treatment given at an effective dose and the conventional treatment is then withdrawn, usually by tapering. The ability to maintain the subjects' baseline status is then observed in the"}

The ability to maintain the subjects' baseline status is then observed in the drug and placebo groups using predefined success criteria. This approach has been used to study steroid-sparing substitutions in steroid-dependent patients, avoiding initial steroid withdrawal and the recrudescence of symptoms in a wash-out period. The approach has also been used to study antiepileptic drug monotherapy. 2.1.5.2.2 \"Early Escape”; Rescue Treatment It is possible to design a study to plan for early escape from ineffective therapy. Early escape refers to prompt remova l of subjects whose clinical status worsens or fails to improve to a defined level (blood pressure not controlled by a prespecified time, seizure rate grea ter than some pres cribed value, blood pressure rising to a certain level, angi na frequency above a defined level, liver enzymes failing to normalize by a preset time in patients with hepatitis), who have a single event that treatment was in tended to prevent (first recurrence of unstable angina, grand mal seizure, paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia), or who otherwise require rescue treatment. In such cases, the need to change treatment becomes a study endpoint. Th e criteria for deciding whether these endpoints have occurred should be well specified, and the timing of measurements should ensure that patients will not remain untreated with an active drug while their disease is poorly controlled. The primary difficulty with this trial design is that it may gi ve information only on short-term effectiveness. The randomized withdrawal trial (see section 2.1.5.2.4), however, which can also incorporat e early-escape features, can give information on long-term effectiveness. 2.1.5.2.3 Limited Placebo Period In a situation where long-term placebo treatment would not be acceptable, the use of a placebo group for a short period at the beginning of an active control trial could establish assay sensitivity (at least for short-term effects). The trial would then continue without the placebo group. 2.1.5.2.4 Randomized Withdrawal In a randomized withdrawal trial, subjects receiving a test treatment for a specified time are randomly assigned to continued treatment with the test treatment or to placebo (i.e., withdrawal of active therapy). Subjects for such a Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 17 trial could be derived from an organized open single-arm study, from an existing clinical cohort (but usually with a protocol-specified \"wash-in\" phase to establish the initial on-therapy baseline) , from the active arm of a controlled trial, or from one or both arms of an a ctive control trial. Any difference that emerges between the group receiving continued treatment and the group randomized to placebo would demonstrate the effect of the active treatment. The pre-randomization observation period on treatment can be of any length; this approach can therefore be used to study long-term persistence of effectiveness when long-term placebo treat ment would not be acceptable. The post-withdrawal observation period coul d be of fixed duration or could use early escape or time to event (e.g., rela pse of depression) approaches. As with the early-escape design, careful attention should be paid to procedures for monitoring patients and assessing study endpoints to ensure that patients failing on an assigned treatment are identified rapidly. The randomized withdrawal approach is useful in several situations. First, it may be suitable for drugs that appear to resolve an episode of recurring illness (e.g., antidepressants), in which case the withdrawal study is, in effect, a relapse-prevention study. Second, it may be used for drugs that suppress a symptom or sign (chronic pain, hyperte nsion, angina), but where a long-term placebo-controlled trial would be difficult; in this case, the study can establish long-term efficacy. Third, the design is particularly useful in determining how long a therapy should be continued (e.g., post-infarction treatments with a beta-blocker). The general advantage of randomized withdrawal designs, when used with an early-escape endpoint, such as return of symptoms, is that the period of placebo exposure with poor response t hat a patient would have to undergo is short. Dosing issues can be addressed by this type of design. After all patients have received an initial fixed dose, they could be randomly assigned in the withdrawal phase to several different doses (as well as placebo), a particularly useful approach when there is reason to think the initial and maintenance doses might be different, either on pharmacodynamic grounds or because there is substantial accumulation of active drug resulting from a long half life of parent drug or active metabolite. Note that the randomized withdrawal design could be used to assess dose-respons e after an initial placebo-controlled titration study (see ICH E4). The titrati on study is an efficient"}

Note that the randomized withdrawal design could be used to assess dose-respons e after an initial placebo-controlled titration study (see ICH E4). The titrati on study is an efficient design for establishing effectiveness, but does not give good dose-response information in many cases. The randomized withdraw al phase, with responders randomly assigned to several fixed doses and plac ebo, will permit dose-response to be studied rigorously while allowing the effi ciency of the titration design to be used in the initial phase of the trial. In using randomized withdrawal designs, it is important to appreciate the possibility of withdrawal phenomena, sugge sting the wisdom of relatively slow tapering. A patient may develop toleranc e to a drug such that no benefit is being accrued, but the drug’s withdrawal may lead to disease exacerbation, resulting in an erroneous conclusion of pers isting efficacy. It is also important to realize that treatment effects observ ed in these trials may be larger than those seen in an unselected population because randomized withdrawal Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 18 studies are enriched with responders and exclude people who cannot tolerate the drug. This phenomenon results when the trial explicitly includes only subjects who appear to have responded to the drug or includes only people who have completed a previous phase of study (which is often an indicator of a good response and always indicates ability to tolerate the drug). In the case of studies intended to determine how long a therapy should be continued, such entry criteria provide the study population and comparison of interest. 2.1.5.2.5 Other Desi gn Considerations In any placebo-controlled study, unbalanced randomization (e.g., 2:1, study drug to placebo) may enhance the safety data base and may also make the study more attractive to patients and/or investigators. 2.1.6 Advantages of Placebo-controlled Trials 2.1.6.1 Ability to Demonstrate Efficacy Like other superiority trials, a placebo-controlled trial contains internal evidence of assay sensitivity. When a difference is demonstrated it is interpretable without reference to external findings. 2.1.6.2 Measures \"Absolute\" Efficacy and Safety The placebo-controlled trial measures the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment. In contrast, an a ctive control trial or a dose-comparison trial measures the effect relative to ano ther treatment. The placebo-controlled trial also allows a distinction between adverse events due to the drug and those due to the underlying disease or \"background noise\". The absolute effect size information is valuable in a three-grou p trial (test, placebo, active), even if the primary purpose of the trial is the test versus active control comparison. 2.1.6.3 Efficiency Placebo-controlled trials are efficient in that they can detect treatment effects with a smaller sample size than any other type of concurrently controlled study. 2.1.6.4 Minimizing the Effect of Subject and Investigator Expectations Use of a blinded placebo control may decrease the amount of improvement resulting from subject or investigator expectations because both are aware that some subjects will receive no active drug. This may increase the ability of the study to detect true drug effects. 2.1.7 Disadvantages of Placebo-controlled Trials 2.1.7.1 Ethical Concerns (See Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4) When effective therapy that is known to prevent death or irreversible morbidity exists for a particular populati on, that population cannot usually be ethically studied in placebo-controlled trials; the particular conditions and populations for which this is true may be controversial. Ethical concerns may also direct studies toward less ill subjects or toward examination of short-term endpoints when long-term outcomes are of greater interest. Where a placebo- Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 19 controlled trial is unethical and an active control trial would not be credible, it may be very difficult to study new drugs at all. For example, it would not be considered ethical to carry out a placebo-controlled trial of a thrombolytic agent in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Yet it would be difficult in the current environment to establish a valid non-inferiority margin based on historical data because of the emergenc e of acute revascularization procedures that might alter the size of the benefits of the thrombolytics. The designs described in section 2.1.5 may be useful in some of these cases. 2.1.7.2 Patient and Physician Practical Concerns Physicians and/or patients may be reluct ant to accept the possibility that the patient will be assigned to the placebo treatment, even if there is general agreement that withholding or delaying treatment will not result in harm. Subjects who sense they are not impr oving may withdraw from treatment because they attribute lack of effect to having been treated with placebo, complicating the analysis of the study. With care, however, withdrawal for lack of effectiveness can"}

Subjects who sense they are not impr oving may withdraw from treatment because they attribute lack of effect to having been treated with placebo, complicating the analysis of the study. With care, however, withdrawal for lack of effectiveness can sometimes be used as a study endpoint. Although this may provide some information on drug effectiveness, such information is less precise than actual information on clinic al status in subjects receiving their assigned treatment. 2.1.7.3 Generalizability It is sometimes argued that any controlled trial, but especially a placebo- controlled trial, represents an artifici al environment that gives results different from true \"real world\" effe ctiveness. If study populations are unrepresentative in placebo-controlled tri als because of ethical or practical concerns, questions about the generalizability of study results can arise. For example, patients with more serious disease may be excluded by protocol, investigator, or patient choice from plac ebo-controlled trials. In some cases, only a limited number of patients or ce nters may be willing to participate in studies. Whether these concerns actually (as opposed to theoretically) limit generalizability has not been established. 2.1.7.4 No Comparative Information Placebo-controlled trials lacking an active control give little useful information about comparative effectiveness, information that is of interest and importance in many circumstances. Such information cannot reliably be obtained from cross-study comparisons, as the conditions of the studies may have been quite different. 2.2 No-treatment Concurrent Control (See Section 1.3.2) The randomized no-treatment control is similar in its general properties and its advantages and disadvantages to the plac ebo-controlled trial. Unlike the placebo- controlled trial, however, it cannot be fully blinded, and this can affect all aspects of the trial, including subject retention, patient management, and all aspects of observation (see section 1.2.2). This design is appropriate in circumstances where a placebo-controlled trial would be performed, except that blinding is not feasible or practical. When this design is used, it is desirable to have critical decisions, such as eligibility and endpoint determination or changes in management, made by an observer blinded to treatment assignment. Decisions related to data analysis, such as Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 20 inclusion of patients in analysis sets, should also be made by individuals without access to treatment assignment. See ICH E9 for further discussion. 2.3 Dose-response Concurrent Control (See Section 1.3.3) 2.3.1 Description A dose-response study is one in which subje cts are randomly assigned to two or more dosage groups, with or without a placebo group. Dose-response studies are carried out to establish the relation between dose and efficacy and adverse effects and/or to demonstrate efficacy. The first use is cons idered in ICH E4; the use to demonstrate efficacy is the subject of this guidance. Evidence of efficacy could be based on significant differences in pair-wise compar isons between dosage groups or between dosage groups and placebo, or on eviden ce of a significant positive trend with increasing dose, even if no two groups are significantly different. In the latter case, however, further study may be needed to a ssess the effectiveness of the low doses. As noted in ICH E9, the particular approach for the primary efficacy analysis should be prespecified. Studies in which the treatment groups vary in regimen raise many of the same considerations as dose-response trials. Since the use of regimen-controled trials to establish efficacy is uncommon, the current discussion is focussed on dose-response trials. There are several advantages to inclusio n of a placebo (zero-dose) group in a dose-response study. First, it avoids studies that are unint erpretable because all doses produce similar effects so that one c annot assess whether all doses are equally effective or equally ineffective. Second, th e placebo group permits an estimate of the total pharmacologically mediated effect of treatment, although the estimate may not be very precise if the dosing groups are rela tively small. Third, as the drug-placebo difference is generally larger than inter-do se differences, use of placebo may permit smaller sample sizes. The size of various dose groups need not be identical; e.g., larger samples could be used to give mo re precise information about the effect of smaller doses or be used to increase the powe r of the study to show a clear effect of what is expected to be the optimal dose. Dose-response studies can include one or more doses of an active control treatment. Randomized withdrawal designs can also assign subjects to multiple dosage levels. 2.3.2 Ability to Minimize Bias If the dose-response study is blinded, it shares with other randomized and blinded designs an ability to minimize subject and investigator bias. When a drug has pharmacologic effects that could break the blin d for some patients or investigators, it may be easier"}

When a drug has pharmacologic effects that could break the blin d for some patients or investigators, it may be easier to preserve blinding in a dose-response study than in a placebo- controlled trial. Masking treatments ma y necessitate multiple dummies or preparation of several different doses that look alike. 2.3.3 Ethical Issues The ethical and practical concerns related to a dose-response study are similar to those affecting placebo-controlled trials. Where there is therapy known to be effective in preventing death or irreversible morbidit y, it is no more ethically acceptable to randomize deliberately to subeffective cont rol therapy than it is to randomize to placebo. Where therapy is directed at less se rious conditions or where the toxicity of Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 21 the therapy is substantial relative to it s benefits, dose-response studies that use lower, potentially less effective and less toxic doses or placebo may be acceptable to patients and investigators. 2.3.4 Usefulness of Dose-response St udies and Validity of Inference in Particular Situations In general, a blinded dose-response study is useful for the determination of efficacy and safety in situations where a placebo-controlled trial would be useful and has similar credibility (see section 2.1.4). 2.3.5 Modifications of Design and Comb inations with Other Controls That Can Resolve Ethical, Practical or Inferential Problems In general, the sorts of modification made to placebo-controlled studies to mitigate ethical, practical, or inferential problems are also applicable to dose-response studies (see section 2.1.5). 2.3.6 Advantages of Dose-response Trials 2.3.6.1 Efficiency Although a comparison of a large, fully effective dose to placebo may be maximally efficient for showing efficacy, this design may produce unacceptable toxicity and gives no dose-response info rmation. When the dose-response is monotonic, the dose-response trial is re asonably efficient in showing efficacy and also yields dose-response information. If the optimally effective dose is not known, it may be more prudent to study a range of doses than to choose a single dose that may prove to be s uboptimal or to have unacceptable adverse effects. 2.3.6.2 Possible Ethical Advantage In some cases, notably those in which th ere is likely to be dose-related efficacy and dose-related important toxicity, th e dose-response study may represent a difference-showing trial that can be ethically or practically conducted, even where a placebo-controlled trial could not be, because there is reason for patients and investigators to accept lesser effectiveness in return for greater safety. 2.3.7 Disadvantages of Dose-response Study A potential problem that should be recogniz ed is that a positive dose-response trend (i.e., a significant correlation between the dose and the efficacy outcome), without significant pair-wise differences, can establ ish efficacy (see section 2.3.1), but may leave uncertainty as to which doses (other t han the largest) are actually effective. Of course, a single-dose study poses a similar problem with respect to doses below the one studied, giving no information at all about such doses. It should also be appreciated that it is not uncommon to show no difference between doses in a dose-response study; if there is no placebo group this is usually an uninformative outcome. If the therapeutic range is not known at all, the design may be inefficient, as many patients may be assigned to sub-therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 22 Dose-response designs may be less efficien t than placebo-controlled titration designs for showing the presence of a drug effect; they do, however, in most cases provide better dose-response information (see ICH E4). 2.4 Active Control (See Section 1.3.4) 2.4.1 Description An active control (positive control) trial is one in which an investigational drug is compared with a known active drug. Such trials are randomized and usually double- blind. The most crucial design question is whether the trial is intended to show a difference between the two treatments or to show non-inferiority or equivalence. A sponsor intending to demonstrate effecti veness by means of a trial showing non- inferiority of the test drug to a standard agent needs to address the issue of the assay sensitivity of the trial, as discussed in section 1.5. In a non-inferiority or equivalence trial, the active control treatment needs to be of established efficacy at the dose used and under the conditions of the study (see IC H E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials). In general, this means it should be a drug acceptable in the region to which the studies will be submitted for the same in dication at the dose being studied. A superiority study favoring the test drug, on the other hand, is readily interpretable"}

In general, this means it should be a drug acceptable in the region to which the studies will be submitted for the same in dication at the dose being studied. A superiority study favoring the test drug, on the other hand, is readily interpretable as evidence of efficacy, even if the dose of acti ve control is too low or the active control is of uncertain benefit (but not if it could be harmful). Such a result, however -- superiority in the trial of the test agent to the control -- is interpretable as true superiority of the test treatment to the control treatment only when the active control is used in appropriate patients at an appropriate dose and schedule (see section 1.4.3). Lack of appropriate use of the control treatment would also make the study unusable as a non-inferiority study, if superiority of the test drug is not shown, because assay sensitivity of the study would not be ensured (see section 1.5.2). 2.4.2 Ability to Minimize Bias A randomized and blinded active contro l trial generally minimizes subject and investigator bias, but a note of caution is warranted. In a non-inferiority trial, investigators and subjects know that all s ubjects are getting active drug, although they do not know which one. This could lead to a tendency toward categorizing borderline cases as successes in partially subjective evaluations, e.g., in an antidepressant study, which could decreas e observed treatment differences and increase the likelihood that a finding of non-inferiority would not represent evidence of effectiveness. 2.4.3 Ethical Issues Active control trials are generally consider ed to pose fewer ethical and practical problems than placebo-controlled trials because all subjects receive active treatment. It should be appreciated, however, that subjects receiving a new treatment are not receiving standard therapy (just as a placebo control group is not) and may be receiving an ineffective or harmful drug. This is an important matter if the active control therapy is known to improve survival or decrease the occurrence of irreversible morbidity, i.e., conditions in which a placebo or no treatment control would be unacceptable. There should therefore be a sound rationale for the test treatment. If there is no strong reason to expect the new drug to be at least as good as the standard, an add-on study (see section 2.1.5.2.1) may be more appropriate, if the conditions allow such a design. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 23 2.4.4 Usefulness of Active Control Trials and Validity of Inference in Particular Situations When a new treatment shows an advantage over an active control, the study is readily interpreted as showing efficacy, just as any other superiority trial is, assuming that the active control is not actually harmful . When an active control trial is used to show efficacy by demonstrating non-inferior ity, there is the special consideration of assay sensitivity, which is considered above in section 1.5. The active control trial can also be used to assess comparative efficacy if assay sensitivity is established. 2.4.5 Modifications of Design and Comb inations with Other Controls That Can Resolve Ethical, Practical, or Inferential Issues As discussed earlier (section 2.1.5), active control trials can include a placebo group, multiple-dose groups of the test drug, and/or other dose groups of the active control. Comparative dose-response studies, in which there are several doses of both test and active control, are typical in analgesic trials. The doses in active control trials can be fixed or titrated, and both cross-over and parallel designs can be used. The assay sensitivity of a non-inferiority trial c an sometimes be supported by a randomized placebo-controlled withdrawal phase at the en d (see section 2.1.5.2.4) or by an initial short period of comparison to placebo (see section 2.1.5.2.3). Active control superiority studies in selected populations (nonresponders to other therapy or to the active control) can be very useful and are generally easy to interpret, although the results may not be generalizable. 2.4.6 Advantages of Active Control Trials 2.4.6.1 Ethical and Practical Advantages The active control design, whether in tended to show non-inferiority or equivalence or superiority, reduces ethica l concerns that arise from failure to use drugs with documented important he alth benefits. It also addresses patient and physician concerns about failure to use documented effective therapy. Recruitment and IRB/IEC approv al may be facilitated, and it may be possible to study larger samples. Ther e may be fewer withdrawals due to lack of effectiveness. 2.4.6.2 Information Content Where superiority to an active treatment is shown, active control studies are readily interpretable regarding evidence of efficacy.

The larger sample sizes needed are sometimes more achievable and acceptable in active control trials and can provide more safety information. Active control trials also can, if properly designed, provide information about relative efficacy. 2.4.7 Disadvantages of Active Control Trials 2.4.7.1 Information Content See section 1.5 for discussion of the problem of assay sensitivity and the ability of the trial to support an efficacy conclu sion in non-inferiority or equivalence trials. Even when assay sensitivity is supported and the study is suitable for detecting efficacy, there is no direct asse ssment of effect size, and there is also greater difficulty in quantitating safety outcomes. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 24 2.4.7.2 Large Sample Size Generally, the non-inferiority margin to be excluded is chosen conservatively in order to be reasonably sure that th e margin is not greater than the smallest effect size that the active control wo uld reliably be expected to have. In addition, because there will usually be an intent to rule out loss of more than some reasonable fraction (see section 1.5.1) of the control drug effect, a still smaller non-inferiority margin is often used. Because the choice of the margin will therefore be conservative, sample si zes may be very large. In an active control superiority trial, the expected difference between two drugs is always smaller than the expected difference be tween test drug and placebo, again leading to large sample sizes. 2.5 External Control (Including Historical Control, See Section 1.3.5) 2.5.1 Description An externally controlled trial is one in wh ich the control group consists of patients who are not part of the same randomized study as the group receiving the investigational agent; i.e., there is no co ncurrently randomized control group. The control group is thus not derived from ex actly the same population as the treated population. Usually, the control group is a well-documented population of patients observed at an earlier time (historical control), but it could be a group at another institution observed contemporaneously, or even a group at the same institution but outside the study. An external control study could be a superiority study (e.g., comparison with an untreated group) or a non-inferiority study. Sometimes certain patients from a larger external experience are selected as a control group on the basis of particular characteristics that make them similar to the treatment group; there may even be an attempt to match particular control and treated patients. In so-called baseline-controlled studies, the pa tient's state over time is compared with their baseline state. Although these studies are sometimes thought to use \"the patient as his own control\", they do not in fact have an internal control. Rather, changes from baseline are compared with an estimate of what would have happened to the patients in the absence of treatment with the test drug. Both baseline- controlled trials and trials that use a more complicated sequential on-off-on (drug, placebo, drug) design, but that do not in clude a concurrently randomized control group, are of this type. As noted, in these trials the observed changes from baseline or between study periods are always compared, at least implicitly, to some estimate of what would have happened without the intervention. Such estimates are generally made on the basis of general knowledge, without reference to a specific control population. Although in some cases this is plainly reasonable, e.g., when the effect is dramatic, occurs rapidly following treat ment, and is unlikely to have occurred spontaneously (e.g., general anesthesia, ca rdioversion, measurable tumor shrinkage), in most cases it is not so obvious and a specif ic historical experience should be sought. Designers and analysts of such trials need to be aware of the limitations of this type of study and should be prepared to justify its use. 2.5.2 Ability to Minimize Bias Inability to control bias is the major and well-recognized limitation of externally controlled trials and is sufficient in many case s to make the design unsuitable. It is always difficult, and in many cases impo ssible, to establish comparability of the treatment and control groups and thus to fulfill the major purpose of a control group Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 25 (see section 1.2). The groups can be dissimila r with respect to a wide range of factors, other than use of the study treatment, that could affect outcome, including demographic characteristics, diagnostic cr iteria, stage or severity of disease, concomitant treatments, and observational co nditions (such as methods of assessing outcome, investigator expectations).

Such dissimilarities can include important but unrecognized prognostic factors that hav e not been measured. Blinding and randomization are not available to minimize bi as when external controls are used. It is well documented that untreated histor ical-control groups tend to have worse outcomes than an apparently similarly chosen control group in a randomized study, possibly reflecting a selection bias. Contro l groups in a randomized study need to meet certain criteria to be entered into th e study, criteria that are generally more stringent and identify a less sick population than is typical of external control groups. An external control group is often identified retrospectively, leadin g to potential bias in its selection. A consequence of the recogn ized inability to control bias is that the potential persuasiveness of findings from externally controlled trials depends on obtaining much more extreme levels of statistical significance and much larger estimated differences between treatments than would be considered necessary in concurrently controlled trials. The inability to control bias restricts use of the external control design to situations in which the effect of treatment is dramatic and the usual course of the disease highly predictable. In addition, use of external co ntrols should be limited to cases in which the endpoints are objective and the impact of baseline and treatment variables on the endpoint is well characterized. As noted, the lack of randomization and blinding, and the resultant problems with lack of assurance of comparability of test group and control group, make the possibility of substantial bias inherent in this design and impossible to quantitate. Nonetheless, some approaches to design and conduct of externally controlled trials could lead them to be more persuasive and potentially less biased. A control group should be chosen for which there is detailed information, including, where pertinent, individual patient data regarding demo graphics, baseline status, concomitant therapy, and course on study. The control patients should be as similar as possible to the population expected to receive the test drug in the study and should have been treated in a similar setting and in a simila r manner, except with respect to the study therapy. Study observations should use timing and methodology similar to those used in the control patients. To reduce selection bias, selection of the control group should be made before performing comparative analys es; this may not always be feasible, as outcomes from these control groups may have been published. Any matching on selection criteria or adjustments made to account for population differences should be specified prior to selection of the control and performance of the study. Where no obvious single optimal external control exis ts, it may be advisable to study multiple external controls, providing that the analyt ic plan specifies conservatively how each will be used in drawing inferences (e.g., st udy group should be substantially superior to the most favorable control to conclude effica cy). In some cases, it may be useful to have an independent set of reviewers reasse ss endpoints in the control group and in the test group in a blinded manner according to common criteria. 2.5.3 Ethical Issues When a drug is intended to treat a serious illness for which there is no satisfactory treatment, especially if the new drug is seen as promising on the basis of theoretical Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 26 considerations, animal data, or early human experience, there may be understandable reluctance to perform a comparative study with a concurrent control group of patients who would not receive the new treatment. At the same time, it is not responsible or ethical to carry out studies that have no realistic chance of credibly showing the efficacy of the treatment. It should be appreciated that many promising therapies have had less dramatic effects than expected or have shown no efficacy at all when tested in controlled trials. Investigators ma y, in these situations, be faced with very difficult judgments. It may be tempting in exceptional cases to initiate an externally controlled trial, hoping for a convincingly dr amatic effect, with a prompt switch to randomized trials if this does not materialize. Alternatively, and generally preferably, in dealing with serious illnesses for which there is no satisfactory treatment, but where the course of the disease cannot be reliably predicted, even the earliest studies should be randomized. This is usually possible when studies are carried out before there is an impression that the therapy is effective.

Studies can be monitored by independent data monitoring committees so that dramatic benefit can be detected earl y. The concurrently controlled trial can detect extreme effects very rapidly and, in addition, can detect modest, but still valuable, effects that would not be credibl y demonstrated by an externally controlled trial. 2.5.4 Usefulness of Externally Controlled Trials and Validity of Inference in Particular Situations An externally controlled trial should generally be considered only when prior belief in the superiority of the test therapy to all available alternatives is so strong that alternative designs appear unacceptable and the disease or condition to be treated has a well-documented, highly predictable course. It is often possible, even in these cases, to use alternative, randomized, concurrently controlled designs (see section 2.1.5). Externally controlled trials are most likely to be persuasive when the study endpoint is objective, when the outcome on treatment is markedly different from that of the external control and a high level of stat istical significance for the treatment-control comparison is attained, when the covariat es influencing outcome of the disease are well characterized, and when the control closely resembles the study group in all known relevant baseline, treatment (other than study drug), and observational variables. Even in such cases, however, there are documented examples of erroneous conclusions arising from such trials. When an external control trial is consider ed, appropriate attention to design and conduct may help reduce bias (see section 2.5.2). 2.5.5 Modifications of Design and Comb inations with Other Controls That Can Resolve Ethical, Practical or Inferential Problems The external control design can incorporate elements of randomization and blinding through use of a randomized, placebo controlled withdrawal phase, often with early escape provisions, as described earlier (see section 2.1.5.2.4). The results of the initial period of treatment, in which subjects who appear to respond are identified and maintained on therapy, are thus \"validat ed\" by a rigorous, largely assumption- and bias-free study. Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 27 2.5.6 Advantages of Externally Controlled Trials The main advantage of an externally controlle d trial is that all patients can receive a promising drug, making the study more attractive to patients and physicians. The design has some potential efficiencies because all patients are exposed to test drug, of particular importance in rare diseas es. However, despite the use of a single treatment group in an externally controlled tri al, the estimate of the external control group outcome always should be made cons ervatively, possibly leading to a larger sample size than would be needed in a plac ebo-controlled trial. Great caution (e.g., applying a more stringent significance level) is called for because there are likely to be both identified and unidentified or unmeasurable differences between the treatment and control groups, often favoring treatment. 2.5.7 Disadvantages of Externally Controlled Trials The externally controlled study cannot be blinded and is subject to patient, observer, and analyst bias; these are major disadvantages. It is possible to mitigate these problems to a degree, but even the steps suggested in section 2.5.2 cannot resolve such problems fully, as treatment assignment is not randomized and comparability of control and treatment groups at the start of treatment, and comparability of treatment of patients during the trial, cannot be ensured or well assessed. It is well documented that externally controlled trials tend to overestimate efficacy of test therapies. It should be recognized that tests of statistical significance carried out in such studies are less reliable than in randomized trials. 3.

Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews. Highlights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include:Number of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis pur- poses, the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of ﬁve total (and from ﬁve to two per organ, maximum).Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes with a short axis of P15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal.Conﬁrma- tion of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of inter- pretation of data.Disease progression is clariﬁed in several aspects: in addition to the previ- ous deﬁnition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum, a 5 mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very 0959-8049/$ - see front matter/C211 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes ‘unequivocal progres- sion’ of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance : the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assess- ment of lesions. Future work: A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufﬁcient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression. As is detailed in the ﬁnal paper in this special issue, the use of these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical validation studies. /C211 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Background 1.1. History of RECIST criteria Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics. Both tumour shrinkage (objective response) and time to the devel- opment of disease progression are important endpoints in cancer clinical trials. The use of tumour regression as the endpoint for phase II trials screening new agents for evi- dence of anti-tumour effect is supported by years of evi- dence suggesting that, for many solid tumours, agents which produce tumour shrinkage in a proportion of patients have a reasonable (albeit imperfect) chance of subsequently demonstrating an improvement in overall survival or other time to event measures in randomised phase III studies (re- viewed in [1–4]). At the current time objective response car- ries with it a body of evidence greater than for any other biomarker supporting its utility as a measure of promising treatment effect in phase II screening trials. Furthermore, at both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development, clinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasingly utilising time to progression (or progression-free survival) as an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn, which is also based on anatomical measurement of tumour size. However, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re- sponse and time to disease progression, are useful only if based on"}

Furthermore, at both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development, clinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasingly utilising time to progression (or progression-free survival) as an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn, which is also based on anatomical measurement of tumour size. However, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re- sponse and time to disease progression, are useful only if based on widely accepted and readily applied standard crite- ria based on anatomical tumour burden. In 1981 the World Health Organisation (WHO) ﬁrst published tumour response criteria, mainly for use in trials where tumour response was the primary endpoint. The WHO criteria introduced the con- cept of an overall assessment of tumour burden by summing the products of bidimensional lesion measurements and determined response to therapy by evaluation of change from baseline while on treatment. 5 However, in the decades that followed their publication, cooperative groups and pharma- ceutical companies that used the WHO criteria often ‘modi- ﬁed’ them to accommodate new technologies or to address areas that were unclear in the original document. This led to confusion in interpretation of trial results 6 and in fact, the application of varying response criteria was shown to lead to very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the same regimen. 7 In response to these problems, an International Working Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardise and simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub- lished in 2000. 8 Key features of the original RECIST include deﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instruc- tions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximum ﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, rather than bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tu- mour burden. These criteria have subsequently been widely adopted by academic institutions, cooperative groups, and industry for trials where the primary endpoints are objective response or progression. In addition, regulatory authorities accept RECIST as an appropriate guideline for these assessments. 1.2. Why update RECIST? Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators have conﬁrmed in prospective analyses the validity of substituting unidimensional for bidimensional (and even three-dimen- sional)-based criteria (reviewed in[9]). With rare exceptions (e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seems to perform well in solid tumour phase II studies. However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which merit answers and further clarity. Amongst these are whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed without affecting the overall assigned response for patients (or the conclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST in randomised phase III trials where progression, not response, is the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients have measurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imag- ing technologies such as FDG-PET and MRI; how to handle assessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmation is truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST in trials of targeted non-cytotoxic drugs. This revision of the RECIST guidelines includes updates that touch on all these points. E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228– 247 229 1.3. Process of RECIST 1.1 development The RECIST Working Group, consisting of clinicians with expertise in early drug development from academic research organisations, government and industry, together with imag- ing specialists and statisticians, has met regularly to set the agenda for an update to RECIST, determine the evidence needed to justify the various changes made, and to review emerging evidence. A critical aspect of the revision process was to create a database of prospectively documented solid tumour measurement data obtained from industry and aca- demic group trials. This database, assembled at the EORTC Data Centre under the leadership of Jan Bogaerts and Patrick Therasse (co-authors of this guideline), consists of >6500 pa- tients with >18,000 target lesions and was utilised to investi- gate the impact of a variety of questions (e.g. number of target lesions required, the need for response conﬁrmation, and lymph node measurement rules) on response and pro- gression-free survival outcomes. The results of this work, which after evaluation by the RECIST Working Group led to most of the changes in this revised guideline, are reported in detail in a separate paper in this special issue. 10 Larry Sch- wartz and Robert Ford (also co-authors of this guideline) also provided key databases from which inferences have been made that inform these revisions. 11 The publication of this revised guideline is believed to be timely since it incorporates changes to simplify, optimise and standardise the assessment of tumour burden in clinical trials. A summary of key changes is found in Appendix I. Be- cause the fundamental approach to assessment remains grounded in the anatomical, rather than functional, assess- ment of disease, we have elected to name this version RECIST 1.1, rather than 2.0. 1.4."}

Be- cause the fundamental approach to assessment remains grounded in the anatomical, rather than functional, assess- ment of disease, we have elected to name this version RECIST 1.1, rather than 2.0. 1.4. What about volumetric or functional assessment? This raises the question, frequently posed, about whether it is ‘time’ to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment (e.g. dynamic contrast enhanced MRI or CT or (18)F-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (FDG-PET) techniques assessing tumour metab- olism). As can be seen, the Working Group and particularly those involved in imaging research, did not believe that there is at present sufﬁcient standardisation and widespread avail- ability to recommend adoption of these alternative assess- ment methods. The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progres- sion, as described later in this guideline. As detailed in paper in this special issue 12, we believe that the use of these prom- ising newer approaches (which could eitheradd to or substitute for anatomical assessment as described in RECIST) requires appropriate and rigorous clinical validation studies. This pa- per by Sargent et al. illustrates the type of data that will be needed to be able to deﬁne ‘endpoints’ for these modalities and how to determine where and when such criteria/modal- ities can be used to improve the reliability with which truly active new agents are identiﬁed and truly inactive new agents are discarded in comparison to RECIST criteria in phase II screening trials. The RECIST Working Group looks forward to such data emerging in the next few years to allow the appropriate changes to the next iteration of the RECIST criteria. 2. Purpose of this guideline This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour measurement and deﬁnitions for objective assessment of change in tumour size for use in adult and paediatric cancer clinical trials. It is expected these criteria will be useful in all trials where objective response is the primary study endpoint, as well as in trials where assessment of stable disease, tu- mour progression or time to progression analyses are under- taken, since all of these outcome measures are based on an assessment of anatomical tumour burden and its change on study. There are no assumptions in this paper about the pro- portion of patients meeting the criteria for any of these end- points which will signal that an agent or treatment regimen is active: those deﬁnitions are dependent on type of cancer in which a trial is being undertaken and the speciﬁc agent(s) un- der study. Protocols must include appropriate statistical sec- tions which deﬁne the efﬁcacy parameters upon which the trial sample size and decision criteria are based. In addition to providing deﬁnitions and criteria for assessment of tumour response, this guideline also makes recommendations regarding standard reporting of the results of trials that utilise tumour response as an endpoint. While these guidelines may be applied in malignant brain tumour studies, there are also separate criteria published for response assessment in that setting. 13 This guideline isnot in- tended for use for studies of malignant lymphoma since international guidelines for response assessment in lym- phoma are published separately. 14 Finally, many oncologists in their daily clinical practice fol- low their patients’ malignant disease by means of repeated imaging studies and make decisions about continued therapy on the basis of both objective and symptomatic criteria. It is not intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in that decision making, except if determined appropriate by the treating oncologist. 3. Measurability of tumour at baseline 3.1. Deﬁnitions At baseline, tumour lesions/lymph nodes will be categorised measurable or non-measurable as follows: 3.1.1. Measurable Tumour lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with aminimum size of: • 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm; seeAppendix IIon imaging guidance). • 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable). • 20 mm by chest X-ray. 230 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically en- larged and measurable, a lymph node must beP15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only theshort axis will be measured and followed (see Schwartz et al. in this Special Issue 15). See also notes be- low on ‘Baseline documentation of"}

At baseline and in follow-up, only theshort axis will be measured and followed (see Schwartz et al. in this Special Issue 15). See also notes be- low on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non-target le- sions’ for information on lymph node measurement. 3.1.2. Non-measurable All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes withP10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal dis- ease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inﬂammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identiﬁed by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. 3.1.3. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular comment: Bone lesions:. • Bone scan, PET scan or plain ﬁlms are not considered ade- quate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. How- ever, these techniques can be used to conﬁrm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, withidenti- ﬁable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be con- sidered as measurable lesions if thesoft tissue component meets the deﬁnition of measurability described above. • Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. Cystic lesions:. • Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁned simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by deﬁnition, simple cysts. • ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the deﬁ- nition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are pre- ferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with prior local treatment: . • Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usu- ally not considered measurable unless there has been dem- onstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions would be considered measurable. 3.2. Speciﬁcations by methods of measurements 3.2.1. Measurement of lesions All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 3.2.2. Method of assessment The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each identiﬁed and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evalu- ation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam. Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered mea- surable when they are superﬁcial andP10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by colour photography including a ru- ler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by both clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. Chest X-ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particu- larly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identifying new le- sions. However, lesions on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly deﬁned and surrounded by aer- ated lung. SeeAppendix IIfor more details. CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. As is described inAppendix II, when CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). More details concerning the use of both CT and MRI for assessment of objective tumour response evaluation are provided inAppendix II. Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their en- tirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next (described in greater detail in Appendix II). If new lesions are identiﬁed by ultrasound in the course of the study, conﬁrmation by CT or MRI is ad- vised. If there is concern about radiation exposure"}

If new lesions are identiﬁed by ultrasound in the course of the study, conﬁrmation by CT or MRI is ad- vised. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilisation of these techniques for objective tumour evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to conﬁrm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. Tumour markers: Tumour markersalone cannot be used to as- sess objective tumour response. If markers are initially above E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228– 247 231 the upper normal limit, however, they must normalise for a patient to be considered in complete response. Because tumour markers are disease speciﬁc, instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease speciﬁc basis. Speciﬁc guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published. 16–18 In addi- tion, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125 progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumour assessment for use in ﬁrst-line trials in ovarian cancer. 19 Cytology, histology:These techniques can be used to differenti- ate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by protocol (for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germ cell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can re- main). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological conﬁrmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens dur- ing treatment can be considered if the measurable tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to dif- ferentiate between response (or stable disease) and progres- sive disease. 4. Tumour response evaluation 4.1. Assessment of overall tumour burden and measurable disease To assess objective response or future progression, it is nec- essary to estimate the overall tumour burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in protocols where objective tumour response is the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is deﬁned by the presence of at least one measurable lesion (as detailed above in Section 3). In studies where the primary endpoint is tumour progression (either time to progression or propor- tion with progression at a ﬁxed date), the protocol must specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable disease or whether patients having non-measurable disease only are also eligible. 4.2. Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’ lesions When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a max- imum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identiﬁed astarget lesions and will be re- corded and measured at baseline (this means in instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be re- corded). For evidence to support the selection of only ﬁve tar- get lesions, see analyses on a large prospective database in the article by Bogaerts et al. 10. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all in- volved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements .I tm a yb e the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend it- self to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. To illustrate this point see the example in Fig. 3 ofAppendix II. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumour.

Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm· 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualiﬁes as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement (See also the example in Fig. 4 inAppendix II). All other pathological nodes (those with short axisP10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterise any objective tumour regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identiﬁed as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not re- quired and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘ab- sent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’). 4.3. Response criteria This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumour response for target lesions. 4.3.1. Evaluation of target lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 232 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also dem- onstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 4.3.2. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions Lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identiﬁed as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (mea- sured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examina- tion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as having a short axis of <10 mm. Case report forms or other data collec- tion methods may therefore be designed to have target nodal le- sions recorded in a separate section where, in order to qualify for CR, each node must achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on study, all lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each sub- sequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). How- ever, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they"}

If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a deﬁnable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a de- fault value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measure- ment error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologistis able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm. Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. As noted inAppen- dix II, when non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diame- ters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individ- ual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 4.3.3. Evaluation of non-target lesions This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to deter- mine the tumour response for the group of non-target lesions. While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitativelyat the time points speciﬁed in the protocol. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target le- sions and normalisation of tumour marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target le- sion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see com- ments below) of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 4.3.4. Special notes on assessment of progression of non- target disease The concept of progression of non-target disease requires additional explanation as follows: When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substan- tial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in pres- ence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumour burden has increased sufﬁciently to merit discontinuation of therapy (see examples inAppendix II and further details below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-tar- get lesions is usually not sufﬁcient to quality for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progressionso- lely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. When the patient has only non-measurable disease.This circum- stance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable disease. The same general con- cepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the inter- pretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantiﬁed (by deﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non-measur- able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumour burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228– 247 233 disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufﬁcient to require a change in therapy’. Some illustrative examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 inAppendix II. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be con- sidered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable dis- ease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must"}

While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable dis- ease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial. 4.3.5. New lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no speciﬁc criteria for the identiﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnd- ing of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or ﬁndings thought to represent something other than tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or ﬂare of pre-existing lesions). This is partic- ularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identiﬁed on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that wasnot scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CTor MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans con- ﬁrm there is deﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New le- sions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identiﬁed according to the following algorithm: a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive l FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at fol- low-up: If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease conﬁrmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not conﬁrmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progres- sion occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progress- ing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 4.4. Evaluation of best overall response The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for conﬁrmation. On oc- casion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response. Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression will affect best response desig- nation. The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the ﬁndings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may also require conﬁrma- tory measurement (see Section4.6). Speciﬁcally, in non-ran- domised trials where response is the primary endpoint, conﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the ‘best overall response’. This is described further below. 4.4.1. Time point response It is assumed that at each protocol speciﬁed time point, a re- sponse assessment occurs.Table 1on the next page provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each time point for patients who have measurable disease at baseline. When patients have non-measurable (therefore non-tar- get) disease only,Table 2is to be used. 4.4.2. Missing assessments and inevaluable designation When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa- tient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured le- sions"}

Missing assessments and inevaluable designation When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa- tient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured le- sions and at follow-up only two lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion. 4.4.3. Best overall response: all time points The best overall responseis determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com- plete or partial response IS NOT required: Best response in these trials is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at sec- ond assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol speciﬁed minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is other- wise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a pa- tient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to follow-up after the ﬁrst SD assessment would be considered inevaluable. l A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 234 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com- plete or partial response IS required : Complete or partial re- sponses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point as speciﬁed in the protocol (gener- ally 4 weeks later). In this circumstance, the best overall re- sponse can be interpreted as inTable 3. 4.4.4. Special notes on response assessment When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measure- ment should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF). In trials where conﬁrmation of response is required, re- peated ‘NE’ time point assessments may complicate best re- sponse determination. The analysis plan for the trial must address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progression. For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time point responses of PR-NE-PR as a conﬁrmed response. Patients with a global deterioration of health status requir- ing discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration isnot a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stopping study ther- apy. The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by evaluation of target and non-target disease as shown inTables 1–3. Conditions that deﬁne ‘early progression, early death and inevaluability’ are study speciﬁc and should be clearly de- scribed in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment periodicity). In some circumstances it may be difﬁcult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (ﬁne Table 3 – Best overall response when conﬁrmation of CR and PR required.

Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the ﬁrst time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR. Table 1 – Time point response: patients with target (+/– non-target) disease.

FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent ﬁbrosis or scarring. The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by dis- ease speciﬁc medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy res- olution/sensitivity. For equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is conﬁrmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. 4.5. Frequency of tumour re-evaluation Frequency of tumour re-evaluation while on treatment should be protocol speciﬁc and adapted to the type and sche- dule of treatment. However, in the context of phase II studies where the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow-up every 6–8 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) is reasonable. Smaller or greater time intervals than these could be justiﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The proto- col should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated at baseline (usually those most likely to be involved with meta- static disease for the tumour type under study) and how often evaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non-target sites are evaluated at each assessment. In selected circum- stances certain non-target organs may be evaluated less fre- quently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identiﬁed in target disease or when progression in bone is suspected. After the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tu- mour evaluations depends on whether the trial has as a goal the response rate or the time to an event (progression/death). If ‘time to an event’ (e.g. time to progression, disease-free survival, progression-free survival) is the main endpoint of the study, then routine scheduled re-evaluation of protocol speciﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomised com- parative trials in particular, the scheduled assessments should be performed as identiﬁed on a calendar schedule (for example: every 6–8 weeks on treatment or every 3–4 months after treatment) and should not be affected by delays in therapy, drug holidays or any other events that might lead to imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of disease assessment. 4.6.

Conﬁrmatory measurement/duration of response 4.6.1. Conﬁrmation In non-randomised trials where response is the primary end- point, conﬁrmation of PR and CR is required to ensure re- sponses identiﬁed are not the result of measurement error. This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has traditionally required conﬁrmation in such trials (see the paper by Bogaerts et al. in this Special Issue 10). However, in all other circum- stances, i.e. in randomised trials (phase II or III) or studies where stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints, conﬁrmation of response is not required since it will not add va- lue to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for response conﬁrmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in partic- ular in studies which are not blinded. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is deﬁned in the study protocol. 4.6.2. Duration of overall response The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR/PR (whichever is ﬁrst recorded) until the ﬁrst date that recurrent or progressive dis- ease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progres- sive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR until the ﬁrst date that recurrent disease is objectively documented. 4.6.3. Duration of stable disease Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomised trials, from date of randomisation) until the crite- ria for progression are met, taking as reference thesmallest sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD). The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease var- ies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of pa- tients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval required between two measurements for determination of stable disease. Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression-free survival are inﬂuenced by the frequency of follow-up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this guideline to deﬁne a standard follow-up frequency. The fre- quency should take into account many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into account if compari- sons between trials are to be made. 4.7. Progression-free survival/proportion progression-free 4.7.1. Phase II trials This guideline is focused primarily on the use of objective re- sponse endpoints for phase II trials. In some circumstances, ‘re- sponse rate’ may not be the optimal method to assess the potential anticancer activity of new agents/regimens. In such cases ‘progression-free survival’ (PFS) or the ‘proportion pro- gression-free’ at landmark time points, might be considered appropriate alternatives to provide an initial signal of biologic effect of new agents. It is clear, however, that in an uncontrolled trial, these measures are subject to criticism since an appar- ently promising observation may be related to biological factors such as patient selection and not the impact of the intervention. Thus, phase II screening trials utilising these endpoints are best designed with a randomised control. Exceptions may exist 236 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 where the behaviour patterns of certain cancers are so consis- tent (and usually consistently poor), that a non-randomised trial is justiﬁable (see for example van Glabbeke et al. 20). How- ever, in these cases it will be essential to document with care the basis for estimating the expected PFS or proportion progres- sion-free in the absence of a treatment effect. 4.7.2. Phase III trials Phase III trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed to evaluate progression-free survival or time to progression as the primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progression is relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all pa- tients to have measurable disease. However, restricting entry to this subset of patients is subject to criticism: it may result in a trial where the results are less likely to be generalisable if, in the disease under study, a substantial proportion of pa- tients would be excluded. Moreover, the restriction to entry will slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri- als allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as well as those with non-measurable disease only. In this cir- cumstance, care must be taken"}

Moreover, the restriction to entry will slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri- als allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as well as those with non-measurable disease only. In this cir- cumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the ﬁnd- ings which would qualify for progressive disease for those patients without measurable lesions. Furthermore, in this set- ting, protocols must indicate if the maximum number of re- corded target lesions for those patients with measurable disease may be relaxed from ﬁve to three (based on the data found in Bogaerts et al. 10 and Moskowitz et al.11). As found in the ‘special notes on assessment of progression’, these guide- lines offer recommendations for assessment of progression in this setting. Furthermore, if available, validated tumour mar- ker measures of progression (as has been proposed for ovarian cancer) may be useful to integrate into the deﬁnition of pro- gression. Centralised blinded review of imaging studies or of source imaging reports to verify ‘unequivocal progression’ may be needed if important drug development or drug ap- proval decisions are to be based on the study outcome. Finally, as noted earlier, because the date of progression is subject to ascertainment bias, timing of investigations in study arms should be the same. The article by Dancey et al. in this special issue 21 provides a more detailed discussion of the assessment of progression in randomised trials. 4.8. Independent review of response and progression For trials whereobjective response (CR + PR) is the primary end- point, and in particular where key drug development deci- sions are based on the observation of a minimum number of responders, it is recommended that all claimed responses be reviewed by an expert(s) independent of the study. If the study is a randomised trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded to treatment assignment. Simultaneous review of the patients’ ﬁles and radiological images is the best approach. Independent review of progression presents some more complex issues: for example, there are statistical problems with the use of central-review-based progression time in place of investigator-based progression time due to the poten- tial introduction of informative censoring when the former precedes the latter. An overview of these factors and other lessons learned from independent review is provided in an article by Ford et al. in this special issue. 22 4.9. Reporting best response results 4.9.1. Phase II trials When response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients must have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients included in the study must be accounted for in the report of the results, even if there are major protocol treatment devia- tions or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories: 1. Complete response 2. Partial response 3. Stable disease 4. Progression 5. Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early death, malignant disease; early death, toxicity; tumour assessments not repeated/incomplete; other (specify)). Normally, all eligible patients should be included in the denominator for the calculation of the response rate for phase II trials (in some protocols it will be appropriate to include all treated patients). It is generally preferred that 95% two-sided conﬁdence limits are given for the calculated response rate. Trial conclusions should be based on the response rate for all eligible (or all treated) patients and shouldnot be based on a selected ‘evaluable’ subset. 4.9.2. Phase III trials Response evaluation in phase III trials may be an indicator of the relative anti-tumour activity of the treatments eval- uated and is almost always a secondary endpoint. Ob- served differences in response rate may not predict the clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt for the population studied. If objective response is selected as a primary end- point for a phase III study (only in circumstances where a direct relationship between objective tumour response and a clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt can be unambigu- ously demonstrated for the population studied), the same criteria as those applying to phase II trials should be used and all patients entered should have at least one measur- able lesion. In those many cases where response is a secondary end- point and not all trial patients have measurable disease, the method for reporting overall best response rates must be pre-speciﬁed in the protocol. In practice, response rate may be reported using either an ‘intent to treat’ analysis (all ran- domised patients in the denominator) or an analysis where only the subset of patients with measurable disease at baseline are included. The protocol should clearly specify how response results will be reported, including any subset analyses that are planned. The original version of RECIST suggested that in phase III trials one could write protocols using a ‘relaxed’ interpreta- tion of the RECIST guidelines (for example,"}

Appendix II. Speciﬁcations for standard anatomical radiological imaging These protocols for image acquisition of computed tomogra- phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recom- mendations intended for patients on clinical trials where RECIST assessment will be performed. Standardisation of imaging requirements and image acquisition parameters is ideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within a study and results between studies. These recommendations are designed to balance optimised image acquisition proto- cols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob- ally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices. These guidelines are not applicable to functional imaging techniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size. Scanner quality control is highly recommended and should follow standard manufacturer and facility maintenance schedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RE- CIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate to produce reproducible measurements. Imaging quality control for CT includes an analysis of image noise and uniformity and CT number as well as spatial resolution. The frequency of quality control analysis is also variable and should focus on clinically relevant scanning parameters. Dose analysis is al- ways important and the use of imaging should follow the ALARA principle, ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’, which refers to making every reasonable effort to maintain radiation exposures as far below the dose limits as possible.

Speciﬁc.notes Chest X-ray measurement of lesions surrounded by pulmon- ary parenchyma is feasible, but not preferable as the measurement represents a summation of densities. Further- more, there is poor identiﬁcation of new lesions within the chest on X-ray as compared with CT. Therefore, measure- ments of pulmonary parenchymal lesions as well as medias- tinal disease are optimally performed with CT of the chest. MRI of the chest should only be performed in extenuating cir- cumstances. Even if IV contrast cannot be administered (for example, in the situation of allergy to contrast), a non-con- trast CT of the chest is still preferred over MRI or chest X-ray. CT scans: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest. As a general rule, the minimum size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be no less than double the slice thickness and also have a minimum size of 10 mm (see below for minimum size when scanners have a slice thickness more than 5 mm). While the precise physics of lesion size and partial volume averaging is complex, lesions smaller than 10 mm may be dif- ﬁcult to accurately and reproducibly measure. While this rule is applicable to baseline scans, as lesions potentially decrease in size at follow-up CT studies, they should still be measured. Lesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ should be assigned a default measurement of 5 mm if they are still visible. The most critical CT image acquisition parameters for opti- mal tumour evaluation using RECIST areanatomic coverage, contrast administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval. a. Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for most solid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Cover- age should encompass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the disease under evaluation and 240 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 should additionally investigate areas that may be involved based on signs and symptoms of individual patients. Because a lesion later identiﬁed in a body part not scanned at baseline would be considered as a new lesion representing disease progression, careful consid- eration should be given to the extent of imaging coverage at baseline and at subsequent follow-up time points. This will enable better consistency not only of tumour measurements but also identiﬁcation of new disease. b. IV contrast administration : Optimal visualisation and measurement of metastases in solid tumours requires consistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrast as well as timing of scanning. T ypically, most abdomi- nal imaging is performed during the portal venous phase and (optimally) about the same time frame after injection on each examination (seeFig. 1for impact of different phase of IV contrast on lesion measurement). Most solid tumours may be scanned with a single phase after administration of contrast. While triphasic CT scans are sometimes performed on other types of vascular tumours to improve lesion conspicuity, for consistency and uniformity, we would recommend tri- phasic CT for hepatocellular and neuroendocrine tumours for which this scanning protocol is generally standard of care, and the improved temporal resolution of the triphasic scan will enhance the radiologists’ abil- ity to consistently and reproducibly measure these lesions. The precise dose and rate of IV contrast is dependent upon the CT scanning equipment, CT acqui- sition protocol, the type of contrast used, the available venous access and the medical condition of the patient. Therefore, the method of administration of intravenous contrast agents is variable. Rather than try to institute rigid rules regarding methods for administering contrast agents and the volume injected, it is appropriate to suggest that an adequate volume of a suitable contrast agent should be given so that the metastases are demonstrated to best effect and acon- sistent method is used on subsequent examinations for any given patient (ideally, this would be speciﬁed in the protocol or for an institution). It is very important that the same technique be used at baseline and on fol- low-up examinations for a given patient. This will greatly enhance the reproducibility of the tumour mea- surements. If prior to enrolment it is known a patient is not able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufﬁciency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV contrast) should be used to evaluate the subject at baseline and follow-up should be guided by the tumour type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindica- tions to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced"}

For patients who develop contraindica- tions to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non-enhanced) should be performed should also be based on the tumour type, anatomic location of the disease and should be optimised to allow for comparison to the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward. Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions on a different modality and interpretation of non-target disease or new lesions, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality (seeFig. 2 for a comparison of CT and MRI of the same lesion). Oral contrast is recommended to help visualise and differ- entiate structures in the abdomen. c. Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: RECIST measure- ments may be performed at most clinically obtained slice thicknesses. It is recommended that CT scans be performed at 5 mm contiguous slice thickness or less and indeed this guideline presumes a minimum 5 mm thickness in recommendations for measurable lesion deﬁnition. Indeed, variations in slice thickness can have an impact on lesion measurement and on detection of new lesions. However, consideration should also be given for minimising radiation exposure. With these parameters, a minimum 10 mm lesion is considered measurable at baseline. Occasionally, institutions may perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknesses greater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of measurable lesions at baseline should betwice the slice Fig. 1 – Difference in measurement/visualisation with different phases of IV contrast administration. Hypervascular metastases imaged in the arterial phase (left) and the portal venous phase (right). Note that the number of lesions visible differs greatly between the two phases of contrast administration as does any potential lesion measurement.

Most contemporary CT scanners are multidetector which have many imaging options for these acquisition parameters.23 The equip- ment vendor and scanning manual should be reviewed if there are any speciﬁc system questions. d. Alternative contrast agents: There are a number of other, new contrast agents, some organ speciﬁc. 24 They may be used as part of patient care for instance, in liver lesion assessment, or lymph node characterisation 25, but should not as yet be used in clinical trials . FDG-PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for detecting, staging and restaging several malignancies. Criteria for incorporating (or substituting) FDG-PET into anatomical assessment of tumour response in phase II trials are not yet available, though much research is ongoing. Nevertheless, FDG-PET is being used in many drug development trials both as a tool to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy and also in assessment of progression. If FDG-PET scans are included in a protocol, by consensus, an FDG uptake period of 60 min prior to imaging has been decided as the most appropriate for imaging of pa- tients with malignancy. 26 Whole-body acquisition is impor- tant since this allows for sampling of all areas of interest and can assess if new lesions have appeared thus determining the possibility of interval progression of disease. Images from the base of the skull to the level of the mid-thigh should be ob- tained 60 min post injection. PET camera speciﬁcations are variable and manufacturer speciﬁc, so every attempt should be made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner, for serial scans on the same patient. Whole-body acquisitions can be performed in either 2- or 3-dimensional mode with attenuation correction, but the method chosen should be con- sistent across all patients and serial scans in the clinical trial. PET/CT scans: Combined modality scanning such as with PET–CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modal- ity/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recom- mendations in this paper may change rather quickly with time. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT por- tions of a combined PET–CT are of limited use in anatomically based efﬁcacy assessments and it is therefore suggested that they should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic con- trast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST mea- surements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET–CT is of identical diagnostic qual- ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and"}

However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET–CT is of identical diagnostic qual- ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CT portion of the PET–CT can be used for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces addi- tional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. Ultrasound examinations should not be used in clinical trials to measure tumour regression or progression of lesions be- cause the examination is necessarily subjective and operator dependent. The reasons for this are several: Entire examina- tions cannot be reproduced for independent review at a later date, and it must be assumed, whether or not it is the case, that the hard-copy ﬁlms available represent a true and accu- rate reﬂection of events. Furthermore, if, for example, the only measurable lesion is in the para-aortic region of the abdomen and if gas in the bowel overlies the lesion, the lesion will not be detected because the ultrasound beam cannot penetrate the gas. Accordingly, the disease staging (or restag- ing for treatment evaluation) for this patient will not be accurate. While evaluation of lesions byphysical examination is also of limited reproducibility, it is permitted when lesions are superﬁcial, at least 10 mm size, and can be assessed using calipers. In general, it is preferred if patients on clinical trials have at least one lesion that is measurable by CT. Other skin or palpable lesions may be measured on physical examina- tion and be considered target lesions. Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity and mea- surement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical speciﬁcations of the scanning sequences used should be optimised for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with T1 and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium enhanced imaging should be performed. The ﬁeld of view, matrix, number of excitations, phase encode steps, use of fat sup- pression and fast sequences should be optimised for the spe- Fig. 2 – CT versus MRI of same lesions showing apparent ‘progression’ due only to differing method of measurement. 242 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 ciﬁc body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. It is beyond the scope of this document or appendix to pre- scribe speciﬁc MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scan- ners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning tech- niques if possible. Selection of target lesions: In general, thelargest lesions rep- resentative of involved organs (up to a maximum of two per organ and ﬁve total) are selected to follow as target lesions. However, in some cases, the largest lesions may not be easily measured and are not suitable for follow-up because of their conﬁguration. In these cases, identiﬁcation of the largestmost reproducible lesions is advised.Fig. 3 provides an illustrative example where the largest lesion is not the most reproducible and another lesion is better to select and follow: Measurement of lesions The longest diameter of selected lesions should be measured in the plane in which the images were acquired. For body CT, this is the axial plane. In the event isotropic reconstructions are performed, measurements can be made on these recon- structed images; however, it should be cautioned that not all radiology sites are capable of producing isotropic recon- structions. This could lead to the undesirable situation of measurements in the axial plane at one assessment point and in a different plane at a subsequent assessment. There are some tumours, for instance paraspinal lesions, which are better measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. It would be acceptable to measure these lesions in these planes if the reconstructions in those planes were isotropic or the images were acquired with MRI in those planes. Using the same plane of evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesion should always be measured at subsequent follow-up time points even if this results in measuring"}

Using the same plane of evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesion should always be measured at subsequent follow-up time points even if this results in measuring the lesion at a differ- ent slice level or in a different orientation or vector compared with the baseline study. Software tools that calculate the maximal diameter for a perimeter of a tumour may be em- ployed and may even reduce variability. The only exception to the longest diameter rule is lymph node measurement. Because malignant nodes are identiﬁed by the length of their short axis, this is the guide used to determine not only whether they are pathological but is also the dimension measured for adding into the sum of target le- sions. Fig. 4illustrates this point: the large arrow identiﬁes a malignant node: the shorter perpendicular axis isP15 mm and will be recorded. Close by (small arrow) there is a normal node: note here the long axis is greater than 10 mm but the short axis is well below 10 mm. This node should be consid- ered non-pathological. If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time point it should continue to be measured. However, the pa- tient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reap- pears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions. For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR status and the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be consid- ered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumour status was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappeared then reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the sum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in other words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’ single lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en- Fig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target. In this example, the primary gastric lesion (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the top two images) may be able to be measured with thin section volumetric CT with the same degree of gastric distention at baseline and follow-up. However, this is potentially challenging to reproduce in a multicentre trial and if attempted should be done with careful imaging input and analysis. The most reproducible lesion is a lymph node (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the bottom two images). E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228– 247 243 ough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to meet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorisation is based upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually ‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyond the resolving power of the imaging modality employed. The identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a lesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embed- ded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pan- creas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumoural oedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distin- guish on certain modalities between this oedema and actual tumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cells within the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is most critical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible manner from baseline and all subsequent follow-up time- points. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilise the same imaging modality. When lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the le- sions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer sep- arable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged lesion’. Progression of non-target lesions To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ there must be anoverall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease that is of a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the treating physician would feel it important to change therapy.

Frequently asked questions Question Answer What should be done if several unique lesions at baseline become conﬂuent at a follow-up evaluation? Measure the longest diameter of the conﬂuent mass and record to add into the sum of the longest diameters How large does a new lesion have to be to count as progression? Does any small subcentimetre lesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least measurable? New lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it is clear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its deﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the techniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until next scheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the date of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspicion, or it disappears and one may then consider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists How should one lesion be measured if on subsequent exams it is split into two? Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum Does the deﬁnition of progression depend on the status of all target lesions or only one? As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm in the sum Are RECIST criteria accepted by regulatory agencies? Many cooperative groups and members of pharma were involved in preparing RECIST 1.0 and have adopted them. The FDA was consulted in their development and supports their use, though they don’t require it. The European and Canadian regulatory authorities also participated and the RECIST criteria are now integrated in the European note for guidance for the development of anticancer agents. Many pharmaceutical companies are also using them. RECIST 1.1 was similarly widely distributed before publication What is the criterion for a measurable lesion if the CT slice thickness is >5 mm? RECIST 1.1 recommends that CT scans have a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and the minimum size for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is <5 mm). If scanners with slice thickness >5 mm are used, the minimum lesion size must have a longest diameter twice the actual slice thickness What should we record when target lesions become so small they are below the 10 mm ‘measurable’ size? Target lesion measurability is deﬁned at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements, even if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists indicate they are ‘too small to measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, if the lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of 5 mm should be applied. If in fact the radiologist believes the lesion has gone, a default measurement of 0 mm should be recorded If a patient has several lesions which have decreased in size to meet PR criteria and one has actually disappeared, does that patient have PD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears? Unless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or SD) is not PD. The lesion should simply be added into the sum. If the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify for PD When measuring the longest diameter of target lesions in response to treatment, is the same axis that was used initially used subsequently, even if there is a shape change to the lesion that may have produced a new longest diameter? The longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis is different from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time point during follow-up) The only exception to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.1 the short axis should always be followed and as in the case of target lesions, the vector of the short axis may change on follow-up Target lesions have been selected at baseline and followed but then one of these target lesions then becomes non-evaluable (i.e. different technique used) What may be done in such cases is one of the following: What is the effect this has on the other target lesions and the overall"}

(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the centre to be sure that future evaluations are done with the baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable (b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by the same technique which was used to follow patients...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from that technique you retrieve the lesion evaluability (c) If neither (a) nor (b) is possible then it is a judgement call about whether you delete the lesion from all forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that its being non-evaluable makes the overall response interpretation inevaluable without it. Such a decision should be discussed in a review panel It is NOT recommended that the lesion be included in baseline sums and then excluded from follow-up sums since this biases in favour of a response (continued on next page) E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228– 247 245 REFERENCES 1.

Appendix III –continued Question Answer What if a single non-target lesion cannot be reviewed, for whatever reason; does this negate the overall assessment? Sometimes the major contribution of a single non-target lesion may be in the setting of CR having otherwise been achieved: failure to examine one non-target in that setting will leave you unable to claim CR. It is also possible that the non-target lesion has undergone such substantial progression that it would override the target disease and render patient PD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of the measurable disease is stable or responding A patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle 4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does conﬁrmation of PR have to take place in sequential scans or is a case like this conﬁrmed PR? It is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark. In this case, most would consider PR to have been conﬁrmed looking at this overall case. Had there been two or three non-PR observations between the two time point PR responses, the most conservative approach would be to consider this case SD In the setting of a breast cancer neoadjuvant study, would mammography not be used to assess lesions? Is CT preferred in this setting? Neither CT nor mammography are optimal in this setting. MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting A patient has a lesion measurable by clinical exam and by CT scan."}

MRI is the preferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting A patient has a lesion measurable by clinical exam and by CT scan. Which should be followed? CT scan. Always follow by imaging if that option exists since it can be reviewed and veriﬁed A lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic in the centre. How should this be measured? The longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually, necrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. In reporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this phenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis inhibitors) may produce this effect If I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size for measurability? MRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but not lung. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm) as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm and no gap. In the event the MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In the event there are inter-slice gaps, this also needs to be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline Can PET–CT be used with RECIST? At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET–CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented that the CT performed as part of a PET–CT is of the same diagnostic quality as a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the PET–CT can be used for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed 246 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R45 (2009) 228 – 247 13.

A consensus guideline, iRECIST, was developed for the use of modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST, V1.1) in cancer immunotherapy trials, to ensure consistent design and data collection and facilitate the ongoing collection of trial data and ultimate validation. The RECIST Working Group held conference calls and meetings to discuss plans for warehouse creation to validate iRECIST. Key questions were identified, and issues and concerns with response evaluation in immunotherapeutic trials were defined. At a formal kick-off meeting, attendees were asked to provide details of their current approach to evaluating response in immunotherapeutics trials. Thereafter a consensus guideline was drafted and monthly meetings served to develop, review and agree on the guideline and plans for validation. The guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour measurements and definitions for objective change in tumour size for use in trials where an immunotherapeutic is used. In addition, it defines the minimum data to be collected for future trials and those currently in development, to facilitate the compilation of a data warehouse to be used to later validate iRECIST. An unprecedented number of trials have been conducted, initiated or are planned testing new immune modulators for cancer therapy using a variety of modified response criteria. This guideline, developed by a multidisciplinary group including academic, commercial and regulatory members, will allow consistent conduct, interpretation and analysis of trials of immunotherapies. RECIST 1.1 should continue to be used as the primary criteria for response based endpoints for randomised studies planned for licensing applications; iRECIST should be considered exploratory in such trials, although earlier phase trials may consider using primarily iRECIST. 3 Funding: This publication was supported by the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute (grant #021039), the EORTC Cancer Research Fund and the NCI grant number 5U10-CA11488-45. WORD COUNT: 300/300 4 Introduction Changes in tumour burden are frequently used as surrogates of survival / quality of life.1 Validated and consistent criteria are critical. In 2000 the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) Working Group (RWG) simplified the 1981 World Health Response Criteria (WHO)2 after validation in a large data warehouse.3 In 2009 RECIST was refined (RECIST 1.1).4 The RWG ensures RECIST undergoes continuous testing, validation and updates.5–8 Immune modulators (IMs) are one of the most significant classes of new anticancer therapeutics.9–11 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathways are the most actively studied12–18 and agents active on those pathways have recently received marketing authorisation (in some cases conditional pending the completion of other studies) for melanoma, lung, bladder, renal and head and neck cancers.19–24 The novel mechanism of action of these agents, with immune and T cell activation, is postulated to lead to unusual patterns of response, which appeared more pronounced and more frequent than had been described before (such as tumour ‘flare’).

In early trials of immune based therapeutics in melanoma, investigators described unique response patterns, termed ‘pseudoprogression’ (PSPD). Some patients whose disease met the criteria for disease progression based on traditional response criteria such as RECIST (with an increase in the sum of measures of target lesions, unequivocal increase in non-target disease or the appearance of new lesions) were noted to have late, but deep and durable, responses.25–29 Modified response criteria were proposed, based on WHO criteria, (which collect bi-dimensional measurements of target lesions) - the so-called immune-related response criteria (irRC).30 The major modification involved the inclusion of the measurements of new target lesions (≥ 5 × 5 mm up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) into disease assessments. More recently, researchers published revised irRC using unidimensional measurements, based on the original RECIST.31 Subsequent recommendations, some 5 published in abstract form, appear to incorporate RECIST 1.1 recommendations.32–34 These are often referred to as irRECIST, but have not always been consistently applied leading to concerns regarding comparability of data and results across trials, difficulty with pooling databases, and a lack of clarity whether new lesions were measured, if so, how many were captured, and whether measures were incorporated into tumour burden. Current and recent trials have generally used RECIST based immune criteria. Because of the need to standardize and validate response criteria, the RECIST Working Group prospectively planned to create a warehouse of data from trials of immunotherapeutics to test and validate RECIST 1.1 and suggest modifications if required. During the planning and initial collection of the immunotherapeutic warehouse, it was apparent that most trials testing these agents have typically used RECIST 1.1 to define the primary and secondary efficacy based endpoints, and reserved irRC or their modified definition of RECIST for exploratory endpoints.32,33 In addition, as noted above, and described in figure 1, there was considerable variability across clinical trials, including within pharmaceutical companies as well as cooperative groups, as to which criteria were used leading to serious concerns about interpretation of pooled datasets. Finally, virtually all trials used immune-modified criteria utilised independent imaging review by a commercial entity for those criteria, rather than investigator assessments. We believe that response criteria should be applicable across all cancer clinical trials, including those conducted in the academic sector where costly independent review is not feasible. Based on those observations it was decided to develop a Guideline describing the use of a modified RECIST to ensure consistent design and data collection that would facilitate the ongoing collection of clinical trial data and ultimate validation, if indicated, of a modified RECIST 1.1 for immune based therapeutics (termed iRECIST). These guidelines are not intended to define or guide clinical practice or 6 treatment decisions, but rather to provide a consistent framework for the management of data collected in clinical trials of immune based therapies. Treatment decisions rest with the patient and their healthcare team. Terminology iRECIST is based on RECIST 1.1. Responses assigned using iRECIST have a prefix of “i” (i.e. immune complete or partial response (iCR; iPR)) and progression as unconfirmed and confirmed (iUPD, iCPD) in order to differentiate them from responses assigned using RECIST 1.1. Similar nomenclature is used for stable disease (iSD). New lesions are evaluated and subcategorised into those that qualify as target lesions (New Lesion Target (NLT), while all others are referred to as non-target (NL non-target; NLNT). Response assessments are referred to as time-points, while best overall response is unchanged. Development of the Guideline The RECIST Working Group formed a subcommittee and held a series of conference calls and face-to- face meetings in 2015 and 2016 to discuss plans for the development and validation of iRECIST and to review current approaches to evaluating response in IM trials, to identify points of consensus and items that required further discussion. Members of the subcommittee included clinical, statistical and imaging experts in methodology and immunotherapy, as well as representatives from the pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapeutics and key regulatory authorities (supplementary materials: table S1). In June 2016 a formal meeting was held in Chicago, with invited presentations from regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical companies with IM agents in development and academic groups, followed by a structured discussion. Prior to the meeting the 52 invited participants were polled in order to initiate the identification of questions to be addressed as well as the response criteria in use. Ten respondents provided responses prior to the meeting while all 8 presenters identified additional areas of interest. After 7 review and discussion during the meeting, a list of critical questions to be addressed by iRECIST were identified. Those key questions are shown in panel 1. Interestingly, all participants confirmed that RECIST 1.1 was used for primary endpoints, with immune modified response criteria being used in an exploratory fashion, with very few exceptions; in one instance immune modified criteria were used as a co-primary endpoint.

There was more variability in independent imaging review and the period of time that response data were collected after RECIST 1.1 progression and or cessation of protocol therapy. Further calls and meetings were held to develop and plan the later full validation of iRECIST (figure 1). Search strategy and selection criteria This paper describes a consensus guideline, rather than a literature review. However, a database search was conducted using PubMed with the following search terms: immune response criteria (limited to cancer, clinical trials and English; 234 citations), irRC (23 citations) and pseudoprogression (limited to cancer, clinical trials and English; 39 citations). iRECIST The continued use of RECIST 1.1 is recommended to define whether tumor lesions, including lymph nodes, are measurable or non-measurable, as well as the management of bone lesions, cystic lesions and lesions with prior local treatment (such as radiation) (table 1). Similarly, there are no changes to the recommendations regarding the method of measurement, although it is recognized that clinical examination and chest X-ray are rarely used with available modern imaging techniques. The principles used to determine objective tumor response are largely unchanged from RECIST 1.1, while a major change of iRECIST is the concept of ‘resetting the bar’ if RECIST 1.1 progression is followed at the next assessment by tumor shrinkage. 8 iRECIST defines iUPD based on RECIST 1.1 principles; however iUPD requires confirmation; confirmation is based on observing either further increase in size (or in the number of new lesions) in the lesion category (i.e. target, non-target disease) where progression was first identified, or progression (defined by RECIST 1.1) in lesion categories that had not previously met RECIST 1.1 progression criteria. If, however, progression is not confirmed as described above, but instead tumour shrinkage (compared to baseline) meeting the criteria of iCR, iPR or iSD, then the bar is reset so that iUPD must occur again (compared to nadir values) and then be confirmed (by further growth) at the next assessment for iCPD to be assigned. If there is no change in tumour size/extent from iUPD, then the time-point response (TPR) would again be iUPD. This approach allows atypical responses, such as delayed responses that occur after PSPD, to be identified, further understood and better characterized (tables 1-3 and S2 and figure 2). Sample case record forms and protocol sections are included in Appendix 2. Below, sections of RECIST 1.1 that are unchanged are only briefly summarized; readers should refer to RECIST 1.1 for full descriptions. Evaluation of target, non-target and new lesions Most RECIST 1.1 recommendations are unchanged for TPR including the management of lymph nodes, lesions that become too small to measure, lesions that split or coalesce and the definition of CR, PR, SD and PD. Each TPR is based on the evaluation of target lesions, non-target lesions and new lesions. For target lesions, iCR, iPR and iSD can all be assigned after iUPD has been documented, providing that iCPD was not confirmed. iUPD is defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria for PD; iUPD may be assigned multiple times as long as iCPD is not confirmed at the next assessment. PD is confirmed in the target 9 lesion category if the next imaging assessment, (4 weeks but no more than 8 weeks later) after iUPD confirms further increase in sum of measures (SOM) of target disease from iUPD, with an increase of at least 5 mm. See below for conditions under which iCPD would also be declared based on new lesions and or non-target (NT) lesions.). However, the criteria for iCPD (after iUPD) are not considered to have been met if CR, PR or SD criteria (compared to baseline and as defined by RECIST 1.1) are met at the next assessment after iUPD. The status is ‘reset’ (unlike RECIST 1.1 where any PD precludes later CR, PR or SD). iCR, iPR or iSD should then be assigned. If no change is detected, then the TPR is iUPD. The evaluation of non-target lesions at each TP follows similar principles. iUPD (but not iCPD) may have been documented prior to iCR or Non-iCR/non-iUPD and may be assigned multiple times providing iCPD was not confirmed. iUPD is defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria; however, iUPD may be assigned multiple times as long as iCPD is not confirmed at the next assessment. PD in the NT lesion category is confirmed if subsequent imaging, conducted at least 4 weeks (but no more than 8 weeks) after iUPD shows further increase from iUPD.

(See above and below for conditions under which iCPD would also be declared for target and new lesions). The criteria for iCPD are not considered to have been met if RECIST 1.1 defined CR or non-iCR/non-iUPD criteria are met after a prior iUPD. The status is ‘reset’ (unlike RECIST 1.1) and iCR, or non-iCR/non-iUPD is assigned; if no change is detected the TPR is iUPD. RECIST 1.1 defines the appearance of new malignant lesions as denoting true disease progression, providing that other lesions (artefacts or benign intercurrent disease) are appropriately evaluated and discounted if not malignant. These principles of RECIST 1.1 remain useful and clearly identify the management of new lesions which are considered to be potentially artefactual: “If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression 10 should be declared using the date of the initial scan”. However, many aspects of new lesion assessment are unique to iRECIST. If a new lesion is identified (thus meeting the criteria for iUPD), and the patient is clinically stable, therapy should be continued (see below). New lesions should be assessed and categorized as measurable or non-measurable using RECIST 1.1 principles. Five lesions, no more than two per organ, should be measured and recorded as New Lesions-Target (NLT), but should NOT be included in SOM of the original target lesions identified at baseline (Supplementary materials: Appendix 1 and 2). Other measurable and non-measurable lesions are recorded as New Lesion-Non-Target (NLNT). Trialists may choose to measure and record more than 5 new lesions for research purposes, but this is not felt to be practical for general usage. New lesions do not need to meet the criteria for NLT in order to result in iUPD (or iCPD); NLNT can also drive iUPD or iCPD. PD is confirmed (iCPD) in the New Lesion category if the next imaging assessment, conducted at least 4 weeks (but more than 8 weeks) after iUPD, confirms additional new lesions or further increase in new lesion size from iUPD (SOM increase in NLT ≥ 5 mm, any increase for NLNT). Note that if iUPD criteria were met based on progression in one of: T or NT disease or the appearance of new lesions, then RECIST 1.1 defined progression in another lesion category in the confirmatory scan also confirms iCPD. Continued treatment after iUPD As noted earlier, the literature describes ‘PSPD’, with an increase in the size of lesions, or the visualization of new lesions, followed by a deep response, including complete response, that may be durable. Although well described, differentiating transient PSPD from true progression requiring a change in therapy can be challenging. Although early discontinuation of an effective agent is not desirable, 11 continued long term treatment with a non-effective agent past true progression may delay the initiation of potentially effective salvage therapy. Because of this dilemma, we recommend that clinical trials where treatment past initial RECIST 1.1 defined progression (i.e iUPD) is permitted only allow patients who are clinically stable to continue on treatment until the next assessment (at least 4 weeks later); the next imaging assessment should be no longer than 8 weeks later to ensure patients remain fit for salvage therapies. A longer time frame before the next assessment may be reasonable if PSPD is well described in the tumour type (for example melanoma treated with a CTLA4 inhibitor) especially if no effective salvage therapies are available (for example, BRAF wild type melanoma) but must be justified in the protocol. All decisions regarding continuing or discontinuing therapy rest with the patient and their health care provider; iRECIST describes what data are to be collected, submitted and analysed in clinical trials of immune based therapies. Clinical stability requires no worsening of performance status, no clinically relevant increase in disease related symptoms such as pain or dyspnoea felt related to disease progression (generally understood to mean a requirement for increased palliative intervention as below) and no requirement for intensified management of disease related symptoms including increased analgesia, radiation or other palliative care. The imaging findings and the recommendation to continue with treatment despite iUPD must be discussed with the patient prior to a decision to continue treatment being taken. Patients who have iUPD and are not clinically stable should be designated as ‘not clinically stable’ in the CRF. This will allow the BOR to be calculated and the date of iUPD to be used in estimations of progression free survival. 12 If the ‘confirmatory’ scan done confirms iCPD, but the investigator/patient believes that continued"}

Patients who have iUPD and are not clinically stable should be designated as ‘not clinically stable’ in the CRF. This will allow the BOR to be calculated and the date of iUPD to be used in estimations of progression free survival. 12 If the ‘confirmatory’ scan done confirms iCPD, but the investigator/patient believes that continued treatment is appropriate, imaging should continue, and data collected to allow further elucidation of tumour growth dynamics with IMs. For the same reason, and if feasible, it is recommended that even patients who discontinue therapy for iCPD should continue to have disease assessments performed until the start of other systemic or local therapies. Time-point and best overall response Although the principles of the assignment of the TPR and best overall response (BOR) closely follow RECIST 1.1, and reflect assessment of target and NT lesions as well as the presence of new lesions, the possibility of PSPD adds complexity (tables 1-3 and S2 and panel 2). The TPR is calculated using the response assigned for each category of lesion described above (as for RECIST 1.1), but takes into account the last TPR. The algorithm for patients with no prior iUPD is identical to RECIST 1.1. For patients with iUPD at the last TPR, the next TPR is dependent on: the status of all lesions, including T, NT, NLT and NLNT; on whether any increase in size has occurred (either further increase in size OR sufficient to assign a new iUPD where the criteria were not previously met); or the appearance of additional new lesions. For iRECIST, the iBOR is the best TPR response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation. iUPD will not override a subsequent BOR of iSD, iPR or iCR (tables 1-3 and S2). This also means that iPR or iSD can be assigned (TPR or iBOR) even if new lesions have not regressed, or if unequivocal progression (NT lesions) remains unchanged, providing that the criteria for iCPD are not met. 13 Confirmation of response is not required when using RECIST 1.1, except in non-randomised trials, and this is also recommended for iRECIST. The duration of iCR and iPR is from the time the criteria for iCR or iPR are first met while the duration of iSD is still calculated from baseline. The protocol should define how missing response assessments will be handled. It is recommended that assessments that are not done (ND), or are not evaluable (NE) should be disregarded. In that scenario an iUPD followed by ND or NE and then another unconfirmed PD would be indicative of iCPD. Protocols should also be clear whether assessments done after protocol therapy is discontinued can be considered in determination of iBOR; it may be reasonable to include assessments done some weeks or months after protocol treatment has been discontinued if late responses are anticipated (such as with a CTLA4 inhibitor) and patients have not received other systemic or local therapies. Protocols must also specify how any new therapy (such as radiation or surgery), introduced before progression will affect iBOR designation. Other RECIST 1.1 recommendations, including the management of missing assessments remain unchanged, including requiring that the analysis plan must address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in the determination of response and progression. Frequency of tumour re-evaluation In general, follow up response assessment every 6 to 12 weeks is recommended, depending on the frequency of treatment visits - as recommended for RECIST 1.1. The protocol should specify which anatomic locations are evaluated at baseline and follow up and whether bone scans should be repeated each response assessment or only to confirm iPR, iCR, or as clinically indicated. For all trials, especially comparative ones, response assessments should be performed on a calendar schedule and not be impacted by delays in therapy or the requirement for earlier confirmatory scans. 14 Tumour re-evaluation may be performed earlier than originally planned (but not less than 4 weeks or longer than 8 weeks after iUPD) to confirm iUPD (or to confirm iCR or iPR 4 or more weeks later in non- randomised trials). If progression is not confirmed, re-evaluation should continue as originally planned (i.e. if scans were to be done at 8, 16, 24 weeks, and a scan was done at 12 weeks to confirm response, then the next scans should be performed at 16 weeks, as planned). If patients continue on protocol treatment after iCPD, assessments should continue to be performed, in the same planned schedule, until protocol treatment is discontinued. Ideally, all imaging performed after protocol treatment has been discontinued should continue to be recorded on the CRF until subsequent therapies are initiated, and the protocol and informed consent document written to facilitate this. These data will allow further refinement of iRECIST. Statistical and protocol considerations The event"}

Ideally, all imaging performed after protocol treatment has been discontinued should continue to be recorded on the CRF until subsequent therapies are initiated, and the protocol and informed consent document written to facilitate this. These data will allow further refinement of iRECIST. Statistical and protocol considerations The event date to be used for calculation of progression free survival (iPFS) should be the first date that progression criteria are met (i.e. the date of iUPD) providing that iCPD is confirmed at the next assessment (table S2). If iUPD occurs, but is disregarded because of later iSD, iPR or iCR, that iUPD date should not be used as the progression event date. If progression is not confirmed and there is no subsequent iSD, iPR or iCR then the iUPD date should still be used in the following scenarios: if the patient stops protocol treatment because they were not considered to be clinically stable, or no further response assessments are done (patient refusal or protocol non-compliance or patient death); the next TPRs are all iUPD, and iCPD never occurs; or the patient dies of cancer. The CRF collects the reason why confirmatory response assessment was not performed at any TP, such as ‘not clinically stable’, ‘centre error’ or ‘patient refusal or death’. 15 For protocols which permit crossover, or where intermittent schedules are being tested, the protocol should clearly specify whether iUPD or iCPD would be used for a treatment decision leading to crossover and how data subsequent to crossover will be managed and analysed. In general, we suggest iCPD be used especially for scenarios with immunotherapy in both arms and where PSPD is anticipated. Adjuvant trials of IMs are ongoing but have yet to report. Suspected new lesions in the curative setting should always be investigated thoroughly and preferably biopsied prior to the designation of relapse being assigned. If biopsy is not technically feasible, then it would appear to be reasonable to follow the principles of iRECIST with a follow-up scan to confirm relapse in patients who are clinically stable. The collection of anonymised imaging (even if centralized blinded review of imaging studies is not planned) is recommended for all studies using an imaging based endpoint (i.e. response or PFS) if feasible. Although the iRECIST guideline requires the recording of the measurements of up to 5 new lesions, it may be eventually necessary to record additional lesions to have a more precise estimation of progression. Central collection of images will allow further evaluation by an independent radiologist if required. If real time central review is planned, the protocol must clearly define how treatment decisions will be made. It is recommended that phase III clinical trials continue to incorporate both RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST (see table 1 for comparisons) and that RECIST 1.1 should continue to be used to define the primary efficacy outcomes (PFS, PD, BOR). Exploratory analyses using the iPD date (i.e. the first date of iUPD which is subsequently confirmed) can be defined in the statistical analysis plan. Earlier trials may consider using iRECIST as the primary criteria. The protocol should carefully explain which will be the 16 primary criteria used to assess response, and which would be exploratory. This is particularly important for trials which compare an IM arm to a non-IM arm. 17 Discussion: next steps and validation Immunotherapeutics are a major advance in the treatment of an increasing number of cancers. The increasing testing and use of these agents in multiple clinical settings, including adjuvant, first, second and subsequent lines of therapy will require the use of progression based endpoints. RECIST 1.1 may not always adequately capture the unique patterns of response that have been well described in clinical trials of these agents in a low percentage of patients, typically reported as 10% or less, mainly reported in melanoma studies.33-35 The true frequency in trials of other malignancies (including non-small cell lung cancer) is unclear as the majority of trials have reported RECIST 1.1 based response rates,36 but may be less common based on anecdotal reports. Similarly, it is unknown whether this pattern is unique to CTLA4 / PD-1/PD-L1 pathway active drugs or will be reported with emerging immunotherapeutics. Trials testing immunotherapeutics in combination with standard therapies, especially when they are compared to standard therapies, further confound the assessment of progression based endpoints. RECIST 1.1 already addresses the management of ‘equivocal’ progression including suspected new lesions, which may explain, at least in part, the continued use of RECIST 1.1 to define response based primary endpoints. RECIST 1.1 deals with mainly technical differences in scans that give the appearance there may be new lesions or the concept of the isodense lesions at baseline that becomes more visible after the start of therapy since it becomes internally more necrotic as opposed to a true new lesion.

RECIST 1.1 deals with mainly technical differences in scans that give the appearance there may be new lesions or the concept of the isodense lesions at baseline that becomes more visible after the start of therapy since it becomes internally more necrotic as opposed to a true new lesion. However, the intent was never to use those recommendations to manage ‘PSPD’ described with IMs. Although modified response criteria have been used, it is clear that a need exists for a formal guideline, with robust plans for prospective testing, and consistent data collection and validation. Recent and current trials have not always been consistent in the definition of the response criteria to be used, have used trial specific modifications of response criteria where new lesion measurements may or may not be included in 18 the assessment of response, and response assessments after progression defined by RECIST 1.1 are not always collected. Those data are critical to understand the dynamics of tumour response to immunotherapeutics, including whether immunotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action have different effects. Although some progress has been made in understanding tumour dynamics with immunotherapeutics, progress in the field has undoubtedly been limited by limited data sharing across trials, companies and immunotherapeutics. Publications have been based on trials conducted by individual pharmaceutical companies or commercial organizations. In the development of this guideline, virtually all major pharmaceutical companies developing immunotherapeutics participated and have shared their experiences, protocols, response criteria, and most critically, their data. The iRECIST team also included members of the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Although this guideline is consensus based, it is not yet validated as the data warehouse is presently being created with initial trial data already in place. It includes all current knowledge on response dynamics, allowing appropriate management of true ‘PSPD’ but importantly also safeguards patients. Although PSPD is now well described, it remains unusual, occurring in less than 1 in 10 patients. Treatment past radiographic progression may be appropriate only in a small number of patients, and the continuation of treatment past true progression may limit subsequent effective therapies in the patient is no longer fit enough to tolerate. iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression in order to rule out – or confirm – PSPD. While this recommendation is in keeping with that of RECIST 1.1 to continue treatment and repeat imaging in the case of a mixed response or equivocal findings, if PSPD is common, patients may be exposed to a higher 19 risk (from continuing ineffective therapy or increased exposure to radiation) or cost (for the potentially ineffective therapy or the costs of imaging). We recommend these criteria are used for clinical trial protocols rather than to guide clinical practice. Treatment past RECIST 1.1 based progression should only be considered in carefully selected scenarios, when the patient is stable (or improving) symptomatically and where there is a short period before reassessment. We believe this is a reasonable balance. Although at first glance the recommendation to collect measurements of new lesions as defined in this guideline seems onerous, the collection of these measurements and the recording of both RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST for TPR and BOR has several advantages. The relationship between the site of the new lesion and PFS as well as the value of adding new lesion measurements to the SOM can be explored. Continuing to record RECIST 1.1 allows comparison to reported immunotherapy trials (which used RECIST 1.1), as well as chemotherapy trials in the same setting, while at the same time allowing treatment past progression as well as collecting data that will allow further testing and validation of iRECIST. Differences in trial outcomes using RECIST 1.1 versus iRECIST may occur, and the interpretation will be informative. Our proposed plan will enable identification of such situations, and hopefully clarification of underlying mechanisms. Also, in the future it will be possible to quantify the differences in outcome estimation between RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST enabling better informed decisions for future RECIST changes. This strategy will also be useful for trials comparing immunotherapy to non-immunotherapy based therapeutics. RECIST 1.1 and iRECIST should yield almost identical results for non-immunotherapy treatments, based on the current RECIST warehouses; while an IM warehouse and associated sensitivity analysis of endpoints will permit the quantification of potential added benefit for the immunotherapy component. While comparison of iRECIST in such situations incorporates an element of bias by 20 construction, confirmation by overall survival results may gain additional importance. Our current recommendation for the design of randomised studies planned for licensing applications is to continue to use RECIST 1.1 as the primary criteria for response based endpoints. iRECIST should be considered exploratory in such trials, although earlier phase trials may consider using primarily iRECIST.

Defining best overall response when initial progression is seen with RECIST 1.1. Managing response and progression in trials comparing standard agents to immunotherapeutics. Managing response and progression in trials combining standard agents with immunotherapeutics. Whether progression must be confirmed with a second scan; if so which is the date of progression? New lesions: when to measure, how many to measure, and whether all must be measured each subsequent assessment. Optimal timing of frequency of response assessment. Management of therapeutics interventions such as surgery or radiation after response. 26 Panel 2: Key principles to be considered If the criteria for iUPD have never been met, principles follow RECIST 1.1. However if the criteria for iUPD have been met, the next TPR could be: o iUPD – no change noted in any category of lesion. o iSD, iPR or iCR. Here iUPD (followed by iCPD) must occur again. o iCPD, if the category in which iUPD was met at the last TPR shows further increase in tumour burden as evidenced (as applicable) by ≥ 5 mm increase in SOM of target or NLT lesions, further increase in NT or NLNT lesions, or an increase in the number of new lesions. o iCPD of a category which did NOT meet criteria for iUPD now meets the criteria for RECIST 1.1 PD. 27 RECIST 1.1 iRECIST Definitions of measurable and non-measurable disease; numbers and site of target disease Measurable lesions are 10 mm or more in long diameter (15 mm for nodal lesions); maximum of 5 lesions (2 per organ); all other disease considered not- target (must be 10 mm of longer in short axis for nodal disease) No change; however, NEW lesions are evaluated as per RECIST 1.1 but are recorded separately on the CRF (but not included in the sum of lesions for target lesions identified at baseline) CR, PR or SD Cannot have met criteria for PD prior to CR, PR or SD May have had iUPD (1 or more instances), but not iCPD, prior to iCR, iPR or iSD Confirmation of CR, PR Only required for non-randomised trials As per RECIST 1.1 Confirmation of SD Not required As per RECIST 1.1 New lesions Results in PD.

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This guidance provides recommendations to applicants on endpoints for cancer clinical trials submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support effectiveness claims in new drug applications (NDAs), biologics license applications (BLAs), or supplemental applications.2 It also provides background information and discusses general regulatory principles. The endpoints discussed in this guidance are for drugs to treat patients with an existing cancer.3 This guidance does not address endpoints for drugs to prevent or decrease the incidence of cancer. This guidance is a revision of the final guidance of the same title that published in May 2007. This guidance replaces the May 2007 guidance of the same title. In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Oncology Center of Excellence, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs include both human drugs and biological products unless otherwise specified. 3 See the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics for recommendations specific to non-small cell lung cancer clinical trials. See the guidance for industry Pathological Complete Response in Neoadjuvant Treatment of High-Risk Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Use as an Endpoint to Support Accelerated Approval for recommendations specific to high-risk early-stage breast cancer. We update guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA web page. The guidances mentioned in this document are available on the Biologics guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm , and/or the Drugs guidance web page at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm .

The following sections discuss the general regulatory requirements for efficacy and how they have influenced endpoint selection for the approval of cancer drugs.

In conventional oncology drug development, early phase clinical trials evaluate safety and identify evidence of biological drug activity, such as tumor shrinkage. Endpoints for later phase efficacy studies commonly evaluate whether a drug provides a clinical benefit such as prolongation of survival or an improvement in symptoms. The following sections discuss the general regulatory requirements for efficacy and how they have influenced endpoint selection for the approval of cancer drugs. Later sections describe these endpoints in more detail and discuss whether they might serve as measures of disease activity or clinical benefit in various clinical settings. A. Statutory and Regulatory Requirements for Effectiveness The requirement that new drugs show effectiveness is based on a 1962 amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). This law requires substantial evidence of effectiveness and specifies that this evidence must be derived from adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations. Similarly, the Public Health Service Act requires biological products to be safe, pure, and potent.4 Clinical benefits that have supported drug approval have included important clinical outcomes (e.g., increased survival, symptomatic improvement) but have also included effects on surrogate endpoints known to predict clinical benefit (e.g., blood pressure). The accelerated approval regulations (21 CFR part 314, subpart H and 21 CFR part 601, subpart E), promulgated in 1992, allow use of additional endpoints for approval of drugs or biological products that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and that generally demonstrate an improvement over available therapy or provide therapy where none exists. In this setting, the FDA may grant approval based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit.5 Such surrogate endpoints are less well- established than those surrogate endpoints for traditional approvals, such as blood pressure for cardiovascular disease. FDA may also grant accelerated approval based on an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint).6 A drug is approved under the accelerated approval regulations on condition that the manufacturer conducts clinical studies to verify and describe the actual clinical benefit.7 If the postmarketing studies fail to demonstrate clinical benefit or if the applicant does not demonstrate due diligence in conducting the required studies, among other reasons, FDA may withdraw approval of the drug or indication.8 In the following discussion, the term traditional approval denotes the longstanding route of drug approval based on the demonstration of clinical benefit or an effect on a surrogate endpoint 4 Potency has long been interpreted to include effectiveness (21 CFR 600.3(s)). 5 Section 506(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act. 21 CFR 314.510 and 601.41 provide that the Agency may consider “. . . epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence . . .” in determining whether an endpoint is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 provides that FDA may consider “. . . epidemiological, pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other scientific methods or tools.” See guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 6 See guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 7 For a more comprehensive discussion of this condition of accelerated approval and a discussion of other conditions of approval, see the guidance for industry Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions – Drugs and Biologics. 8 See section 506(c)(3) of the FD&C Act and §§ 314.530(a) and 601.43(a). Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 3 known to predict clinical benefit. That term is distinguished from accelerated approval, which is associated with use of a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to support drug approval. The evidence needed to establish effectiveness is discussed in the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products and the guidance for industry FDA Approval of New Cancer Treatment Uses for Marketed Drug and Biological Products. In many cases, at least two adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations are needed. In certain cases, evidence from a single adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation, with confirmatory evidence, can be sufficient (e.g., in cases in which a single multicenter study provides highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of an important clinical benefit). FDA may consider data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence as substantial evidence, if FDA determines that such data and evidence are sufficient to establish effectiveness.9 For example, for drugs approved for treatment of patients with a specific stage of a particular malignancy, evidence from one adequate and well-controlled clinical investigation with confirmatory evidence may be sufficient to support an efficacy supplement for treatment of a different stage of the same cancer. B. Endpoints Supporting Past Approvals in Oncology For traditional approval, applicants show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in a surrogate endpoint known to predict clinical benefit. In oncology, survival improvement is considered an appropriate measure of clinical benefit. In addition, sponsors have used other endpoints for cancer drug approval.

B. Endpoints Supporting Past Approvals in Oncology For traditional approval, applicants show direct evidence of clinical benefit or improvement in a surrogate endpoint known to predict clinical benefit. In oncology, survival improvement is considered an appropriate measure of clinical benefit. In addition, sponsors have used other endpoints for cancer drug approval. In the 1970s, the FDA usually approved cancer drugs based on objective response rate (ORR), determined by tumor assessments from radiological tests or physical examinations. In the early 1980s, after discussion with the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC), the FDA determined that cancer drug approval should be based on more direct evidence of clinical benefit, such as improvement in survival, improvement in a patient’s quality of life, improved physical functioning, or improved tumor-related symptoms. These benefits may not always be predicted by, or correlate with, ORR. Over time, larger improvements in tumor reduction and delay in tumor growth have been seen, and tumor measurement endpoints have been used to support both traditional and accelerated approval. Improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) has supported drug approval in selected adjuvant settings, in which a large proportion of patients were expected to have cancer symptoms at the time of recurrence. Durable complete response has supported traditional approval in leukemia, where complete response (CR) is associated with less infection, bleeding, and blood product support. A large improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) or high, substantiated durable ORR has been used to support traditional approval in select malignancies, but magnitude of effect, relief of tumor-related symptoms, and drug toxicity should also be considered when making the approval decision.10,11,12 For example, randomized trials for 9 See section 505(d) as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997. 10 Blumenthal GM, PG Kluetz, J Schneider, KB Goldberg, AE McKee, R Pazdur, 2017, Oncology Drug Approvals: Evaluating Endpoints and Evidence in an Era of Breakthrough Therapies, The Oncologist, 22(7): 762-767. 11 Blumenthal GM and R Pazdur, 2016, Response Rate as an Approval Endpoint in Oncology: Back to the Future, JAMA Oncol, 2(6): 720-721. 12 O’Shaughnessy and Wittes et al.,1991, Commentary Concerning Demonstration of Safety and Efficacy of Investigational Anticancer Agents in Clinical Trials, J Clin Oncol, 9:2225-2232. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 4 hormonal drugs for breast cancer and a single arm trial of a drug for ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer have used ORR as an endpoint supporting traditional approval. Improvement in tumor-related symptoms in conjunction with an improved ORR and adequate response duration has supported traditional approval in several clinical settings. Surrogate endpoints for accelerated approval must be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit (FD&C Act § 506(c)(1)(A); 21 CFR part 314, subpart H; and 21 CFR part 601, subpart E). While durable ORR has been used as a traditional approval endpoint in some circumstances, ORR has also been the most commonly used surrogate endpoint in support of accelerated approval. Tumor response is widely accepted by oncologists in guiding cancer treatments. Because ORR is directly attributable to drug effect, single-arm trials conducted in patients with refractory tumors where no available therapy exists provide an accurate assessment of ORR. Whether tumor measures such as ORR or PFS are used as an accelerated approval or traditional approval endpoint will depend on the disease context and the magnitude of the effect, among other factors (see sections III.B.2 and 4). III. GENERAL ENDPOINT CONSIDERATIONS This section provides an overview of general issues in cancer drug development. A discussion of commonly used cancer endpoints is followed by a discussion of pertinent issues in cancer clinical trial design using these endpoints (see the guidances referenced in footnote 3 regarding non-small cell lung cancer and high-risk early-stage breast cancer for more detailed discussion for these diseases). The endpoints that are discussed in this section include overall survival, endpoints based on tumor assessments (e.g., DFS, event-free survival (EFS), ORR, CR, time to progression (TTP), and PFS), endpoints involving symptom assessment, blood or body fluid- based biomarkers, and emerging endpoints. Tables 1 and 2 provide a comparison of endpoints in cancer drug approval. Many issues relating to the proper analysis of efficacy endpoints are addressed in the ICH guidance for industry E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials. Recommendations regarding the use of placebos and blinding in randomized controlled clinical trials are described in the draft guidance for industry Hematologic Malignancy and Oncologic Disease: Considerations for Use of Placebos and Blinding in Randomized Clinical Trials for Drug Product Development.13 Cancer patient and caregiver experiences provide unique insights that contribute to important patient preference information for identifying relevant clinical trial endpoints to ultimately inform medical product development programs that best meet patient needs.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 5 Table 1. A Comparison of Important Cancer Approval Endpoints As noted in the table, several oncology endpoints can serve different purposes (i.e., clinical endpoint that represents clinical benefit for traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval) based on the specific context of use. The determination is based on the specific diseases and is highly dependent upon factors such as effect size, effect duration, depth of response (e.g., number of CRs), available therapy, disease setting, location of disease, the clinical consequences of delaying or preventing disease progression or delaying administration of more toxic therapies, and the risk-benefit relationship. See text for details. See section V regarding recommendations for obtaining FDA feedback on endpoints and protocol design.

Overall Survival Overall survival is defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause and is measured in the intent-to-treat population. Survival is considered the most reliable cancer endpoint, and when studies can be conducted to adequately assess survival, it is usually the preferred endpoint. This endpoint is precise and easy to measure, documented by the date of death. Bias is not a factor in endpoint measurement. Survival improvement should be analyzed as a risk-benefit analysis to assess clinical benefit. Overall survival should be evaluated in randomized controlled studies. Data derived from externally controlled trials are seldom reliable for time-to-event endpoints, including overall survival. Apparent differences in outcome between external controls and current treatment groups can arise from differences other than drug treatment, including patient selection, improved imaging techniques, or improved supportive care. Randomized studies minimize the effect of these known and unknown differences by providing a direct outcome"}

Randomized studies minimize the effect of these known and unknown differences by providing a direct outcome comparison. Demonstration of a statistically significant improvement in overall survival can be considered to be clinically significant if the toxicity profile is acceptable and has often supported new drug approval. Difficulties in performing and analyzing survival studies include long follow-up periods in large trials and subsequent cancer therapy potentially confounding survival analysis. B. Endpoints Based on Tumor Assessments This section discusses several endpoints that are based on tumor assessments. In many cancer types, radiographic tumor assessments directly measure components of the disease, and tumor measures commonly trigger treatment decisions in clinical practice. Therefore, tumor measure- based endpoints are considered more clinically relevant than other biomarkers. Tumor measure- based endpoints may support either traditional (as a clinical endpoint that represents clinical benefit or a surrogate endpoint for traditional approval) or accelerated approval and include DFS (and EFS), ORR, CR, TTP, and PFS. Tumor assessment endpoint selection should include two judgments. First, a determination of whether the endpoint may support either accelerated approval or traditional approval should be ascertained. Second, the endpoint should be evaluated for the potential of bias or uncertainty. Drug applications using studies that rely on tumor assessment endpoints as sole evidence of efficacy may need confirmatory evidence from a second trial. Accuracy in measuring tumors can differ among tumor settings. Tumor measurements used in ORR determinations can be imprecise in locations where there is a lack of demarcated margins (e.g., pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma, pancreatic cancer, brain tumors). When the primary study endpoint is based on tumor measurements (e.g., PFS or ORR), tumor assessments generally should be verified by central reviewers blinded to study treatments (see Appendix) to ascertain lack of assessment bias. Additional details regarding data collection are listed in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, Appendix A.16 Alternatively, a random sample-based blinded central review auditing approach could be used with a detailed auditing plan prespecified including a strategy to detect potential assessment bias. If bias cannot be excluded based upon the audit, a blinded central review of all radiographic images will be necessary. 17 Sponsors should seek FDA input prior to conducting an audit based central review. Centralized independent verification of tumor assessment endpoints (especially for PFS or DFS) may not be necessary when randomized trials are blinded (unless the adverse event profile would substantially unblind the trial in practice) or effect sizes are robust in large randomized trials where sensitivity analysis supports lack of investigator bias. 1. Disease-Free Survival (and Event-Free Survival) Generally, DFS is defined as the time from randomization until disease recurrence or death from any cause. The most frequent use of this endpoint is in the adjuvant setting after definitive surgery or radiotherapy. DFS also can be an important endpoint when a large percentage of patients achieve CRs with chemotherapy. Although overall survival is a conventional endpoint for most adjuvant settings, DFS can be an important endpoint in situations where survival may be prolonged, making an overall survival endpoint impractical. An endpoint that is similar to DFS but is differentiated from it in that randomization takes place before definitive surgery or radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting is EFS. For the purpose of this guidance, EFS is defined as time from randomization to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, or death due to any cause. DFS has been the primary basis of approval for adjuvant breast cancer hormonal therapy, adjuvant colon cancer, and adjuvant cytotoxic breast cancer therapy, whereas EFS is an appropriate endpoint for the evaluation of neoadjuvant breast cancer therapy given prior to definitive surgery. Compared with standard cytotoxic therapies, hormonal therapies carry minimal side effects and thus a favorable risk- benefit relationship. Treatment effect measured by DFS or EFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, available therapy, and the risk-benefit relationship. In December 2003, the ODAC consensus was DFS prolongation represented clinical benefit if the magnitude of this benefit outweighed the toxicity of the adjuvant treatment. In May 2004, the ODAC recommended that DFS be considered a clinical endpoint for colon cancer drugs in the surgical adjuvant setting. 18 DFS has been used for traditional approval for diseases such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma.

Important considerations in evaluating DFS or EFS as a potential endpoint include the estimated size of the treatment effect and proven benefits of standard therapies. The protocol should 16 Appendices A-D in the guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, regarding tumor measurement data collection and PFS analysis also apply more broadly to oncology endpoints and should be used in conjunction with this guidance, as needed. 17 Discussed during July 24, 2012 ODAC meeting.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 9 carefully delineate both the definition of DFS or EFS and the schedule for follow-up assessments and visits. Unscheduled assessments can occur for many reasons and differences between study arms in the frequency, timing, or reason for unscheduled assessments can introduce bias. Bias can be minimized by blinding patients and investigators to the treatment assignments, as appropriate. Application of the definition of DFS or EFS in a study can be complicated, particularly when deaths are noted without prior tumor progression documentation. These events can be scored either as disease recurrences or as censored events. Although all methods for statistical analysis of deaths have some limitations, considering deaths from all causes as recurrences can minimize bias. DFS or EFS can be overestimated using this definition, especially in patients who die after a long period without observation. Bias can be introduced if the frequency of long-term follow-up visits is dissimilar between the study arms or if dropouts are not random because of toxicity. Some analyses count cancer-related deaths as DFS or EFS events and censor noncancer deaths. This method can introduce bias in the attribution of the cause of death. Furthermore, any method that censors observations on patients, whether at death or at the last visit, assumes that the patients with censored observations have the same risk of recurrence as patients with noncensored observations who have not yet experienced the event. 2. Objective Response Rate ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with tumor size reduction of a predefined amount and for a minimum time period. Response duration usually is measured from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression. Generally, the FDA has defined ORR as the sum of partial responses plus CRs. When defined in this manner, ORR is a direct measure of a drug antitumor activity, which can be evaluated in a single-arm study. Stable disease should not be a component of ORR. Stable disease can reflect the natural history of disease, whereas tumor reduction is a direct therapeutic effect. Also, stable disease can be more accurately assessed by TTP or PFS analysis (see section III.B.4). If available, standardized criteria should be used to ascertain response. A variety of response criteria have been considered appropriate (e.g., revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1)) 19 The response criteria should be predefined in the protocol before the start of the study. The significance of ORR is assessed by its magnitude and duration, and the percentage of CRs. Treatment effect measured by ORR can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the number of CRs, the durability of response, the disease setting, the location of the tumors, available therapy, and the risk-benefit relationship. 3. Complete Response CR is defined as no detectable evidence of tumor. CR is generally measured through imaging studies (e.g., CT scans) or through histopathologic assessment (e.g., bone marrow biopsy or breast cancer resection specimens). Treatment effect measured by CR can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the 19 Eisenhauer EA, P Therasse, J Bogaerts, LH Schwartz, D Sargent, R Ford, et al., 2009, New Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1), Eur J Cancer, 45(2):228-247.

For early high-risk breast cancer, pathologic CR (pCR) has been used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval. 4. Time to Progression and Progression- Free Survival TTP and PFS have served as primary endpoints for drug approval. TTP is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression; TTP does not include deaths. PFS is defined as the time from randomization until objective tumor progression or death, whichever occurs first. The precise definition of tumor progression is important and should be carefully detailed in the protocol. Compared with TTP, PFS is the preferred regulatory endpoint. PFS includes deaths and thus can be a better correlate to overall survival. In TTP analysis, death events are censored, either at the time of death or at an earlier visit representing informative censoring (nonrandom pattern of loss from the study). PFS assumes that death events are randomly related to tumor progression. PFS can reflect tumor growth and be assessed before the determination of a survival benefit. Its determination is not confounded by subsequent therapy. For a given sample size, the magnitude of effect on PFS can be larger than the effect on overall survival. Data are usually insufficient to allow a robust evaluation of the correlation between effects on overall survival and PFS. Cancer trials are often small, and proven survival benefits of existing drugs are generally modest. Treatment effect measured by PFS can be a surrogate endpoint to support accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint to support traditional approval, or it can represent direct clinical benefit based on the specific disease, context of use, magnitude of the effect, the disease setting, location of metastatic sites, available therapy, the risk-benefit relationship, and the clinical consequences of delaying or preventing progression in key disease sites (e.g., delay of new lesions in the brain or spine) or delaying administration of more toxic therapies. It is important to carefully define tumor progression criteria in the protocol. There are no standard regulatory criteria for defining progression. Applicants have used a variety of different criteria, including the RECIST criteria. The broad outline presented in most published PFS criteria should be supplemented with additional details in the protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP). Because progression data can be collected from multiple sources (including physical exams at unscheduled visits and radiological scans of various types) and at different times, data collection for each assessment visit should be limited to a specified short time interval around the scheduled visit. Difficulties can arise in determining the event date and censoring date when data are collected over a prolonged time period. We recommend assigning the progression date to the earliest time when any progression is observed without prior missing assessments and censoring at the date when the last radiological assessment determined a lack of progression. The guidance for industry Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Drugs and Biologics, Appendices C and D provides a set of tables for potential analyses of PFS that can be used for primary or sensitivity analyses. Plans for PFS data collection and analysis should be discussed with FDA at end-of-phase 2 meetings. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 11 5. Time to Treatment Failure Time to treatment failure (TTF) is defined as a composite endpoint measuring time from randomization to discontinuation of treatment for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, and death. TTF is generally not recommended as a regulatory endpoint for new molecular entity drug approval. C. Endpoints Involving Symptom Assessment Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit. FDA drug approvals have used patient symptom assessments and/or physical signs representing symptomatic improvement (e.g., weight gain, decreased effusion) as an important efficacy endpoint. For the improvement of signs and symptoms or other clinical outcome assessments (COA) to be used as efficacy endpoints to support cancer drug approval, symptoms should be assessed that are due to cancer rather than drug toxicity to the extent possible. 1. Specific Symptom Endpoints Symptom improvement/palliation is a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a surrogate endpoint. A decrease in the severity of cancer symptoms has been used to support traditional approval of anti-cancer agents where anti-tumor activity has also been demonstrated. The use of a symptom palliation endpoint requires that the population be symptomatic at baseline, which can be problematic in many cancer trials where patients can often be asymptomatic at baseline. This endpoint can also be subject to open label response bias, the magnitude of which is not well described. Time to progression of cancer symptoms, an endpoint similar to TTP, is also a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a potential surrogate endpoint. As discussed earlier, problems in measuring progression (e.g., missing assessments) also exist in evaluating time to symptomatic progression. Because few cancer"}

Time to progression of cancer symptoms, an endpoint similar to TTP, is also a direct measure of clinical benefit rather than a potential surrogate endpoint. As discussed earlier, problems in measuring progression (e.g., missing assessments) also exist in evaluating time to symptomatic progression. Because few cancer trials are blinded, symptom assessments can also be subject to response bias. A delay between tumor progression and the onset of cancer symptoms can occur. Often alternative treatments are initiated before achieving the symptom endpoint, confounding this analysis. In addition, tumor symptoms can be difficult to differentiate from drug toxicity. A composite symptom endpoint or symptom scale should have components of similar clinical importance and an analysis of the contribution of the components should be submitted with the primary analysis of the overall composite endpoint. An example is the composite symptom scale that includes several important symptoms of myelofibrosis, the myelofibrosis symptom assessment form. 20 An example of a composite endpoint for clinical events exists for patients with cancer metastases to the skeleton. Drugs have been approved based on delaying the time to skeletal-related events defined as pathological fractures, radiation therapy to bone, surgery to bone, and spinal cord compression. 20 Deisseroth A, E Kamiskas, J Grillo, W Chen, H Saber, HL Lu, et. al., 2012, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval: Ruxolitinib for the Treatment of Patients with Intermediate and High -Risk Myelofibrosis, Clin Cancer Res, 18(12): 3212-7. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 12 Selection of the appropriate population can be critical for documenting symptom benefit. Patients symptomatic at study baseline can be evaluated with a categorical symptom response analysis. In asymptomatic patients at baseline, a time-to-first-symptom analysis can be used, although this approach can be limited by intermittent missing data and discontinuation of the study drug prior to symptomatic progression. 2. Problems Encountered with Symptom Data Missing data and infrequent assessments can complicate the evaluation of symptom data particularly for time to deterioration analyses. Procedures should be put in place to maximize completion rate during trial conduct and the statistical analysis plan should outline how missing data will be handled. Data collection to support multiple symptom endpoints should be addressed prospectively regarding multiple hypotheses testing and the necessary statistical adjustments should be specified in the SAP. Additional information on the use of patient- reported outcomes can be found in the guidance for industry Patient Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims. D. Blood or Body Fluid- Based Biomarkers Generally, biomarkers assayed from blood or body fluids have not served as primary endpoints for cancer drug approval, although paraprotein levels measured in blood and urine have been used as part of myeloma response criteria, and durable major molecular response is a surrogate endpoint used for traditional approval for therapies in chronic myelogenous leukemia. The FDA has accepted blood-based markers as elements of a composite endpoint. The occurrence of certain clinical events (a significant decrease in performance status, or bowel obstruction) in conjunction with marked increases in CA-125 was considered progression in ovarian cancer patients. In addition, blood-based biomarkers can be useful in identifying prognostic factors and in selection of patients and stratification factors to be considered in study designs. E. Emerging Endpoints In addition to the endpoints discussed in this section, FDA recognizes that advances in science are facilitating development of oncology products, which may also result in the identification of additional endpoints that may be used to support approval of oncology products. As examples, minimal residual disease 21 has been used as a surrogate endpoint for accelerated approval for a therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and metastasis-free survival has been used as a clinical endpoint for traditional approval for a therapy in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. If a sponsor is planning to use an emerging endpoint in its clinical development program, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V). 21 See draft guidance for industry Hematologic Malignancies: Regulatory Considerations for Use in Minimal Residual Disease in Development of Drug and Biological Products for Treatment for information to assist sponsors planning to use minimal residual disease to support marketing approval of drugs and biological products for the treatment of specific hematologic malignancies. When finalized this guidance will represent FDA current thinking on the topics it addresses. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 13 IV. CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS Per 21 CFR 314.126, the FDA approves drugs based on substantial evidence of efficacy from “adequate and well-controlled investigations,” as described in the regulations.

CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS Per 21 CFR 314.126, the FDA approves drugs based on substantial evidence of efficacy from “adequate and well-controlled investigations,” as described in the regulations. Studies must allow a valid comparison to a control and must provide a quantitative assessment of the drug’s effect. 22 The most reliable method for demonstrating efficacy is to show a statistically significant improvement in a clinically meaningful endpoint in randomized controlled trials (i.e., superiority). The following sections discuss other approaches that may be indicated when a randomized controlled trial demonstrating superiority is not feasible or ethical. If a sponsor is planning to use one of these approaches, we recommend discussing such use with the applicable FDA Division or Office prior to initiating a trial (see section V). A. S ingle-Arm Studies In settings where there is no available therapy and where major tumor regressions can be presumed to be attributed to the tested drug, the FDA has sometimes accepted ORR and response duration observed in single-arm studies as substantial evidence supporting accelerated approval. Response rates have been used in settings such as acute leukemia for traditional approval where CRs have been associated with decreased transfusion requirements, decrease in infections, and increased survival. Single-arm trials do not adequately characterize time-to- event endpoints such as overall survival, DFS (and EFS), TTP, or PFS. Because of variability in the natural history of many forms of cancer, a randomized study is necessary to evaluate time-to-event endpoints. B. Randomized Studies Designed to Demonstrate Noninferiority A noninferiority (NI) trial should demonstrate the new drug’s effectiveness by showing that the new drug is not less effective than a standard regimen (the active control) by a prespecified amount (noninferiority margin). 23 This noninferiority margin should be a clinically acceptable loss that is not larger than the effect of the active control drug. The standard regimen should have a well-characterized clinical benefit (survival benefit). If the new drug is inferior to the active control by more than the noninferiority margin, it will be presumed to be ineffective. NI trials rely on externally controlled (historical) data to establish the active control’s treatment effect size. In cancer trials, this effect frequently has not been adequately characterized. NI trials also rely on constancy assumption. This assumption includes that the active-control effect has remained constant between the externally controlled study and the current study. This assumes constancy of patient population characteristics, supportive care measures, and evaluation techniques between the current trial and the externally controlled data from which the active-control effect was derived. The estimated size of the active-control’s treatment effect should be based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of externally controlled studies. These studies should reliably reproduce the active-control effect compared with placebo arm. 22 See 21 CFR 314.126(b)(2) and (7). 23 See guidance for industry Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness. See also the ICH guidance for industry E10 Choice of Control Group and Related Issues. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 14 Difficulties in conducting NI trials include the estimation of active-control effect and the determination of amount of effect (NI margin) to be retained. NI trials usually involve large sample sizes compared with superiority trials and involve replication of clinical trial results. Furthermore, subsequent therapies and crossover to the active-control arm can confound any NI analysis. NI trials with endpoints other than overall survival and ORR are problematic. C. Trial Designs for Radiotherapy Protectants and Chemotherapy Protectants Radiotherapy protectants and chemotherapy protectants are drugs designed to ameliorate the toxicities of therapies. These trials usually have two objectives. The first is to assess the amelioration of cancer treatment toxicity. The second objective is to determine whether anticancer activity is compromised by the protectant. The second objective usually examines earlier endpoints; for example, ORR or PFS, rather than overall survival. D. Clinical Trial Design Considerations The methodology for assessing, measuring, and analyzing the endpoint(s) should be detailed in the protocol and SAP. Visits and radiological assessments, when applicable, should be symmetric between the two study arms to prevent systematic bias. The FDA and the applicant should agree prospectively on the following items and the applicant should finalize the items before the initiation of the study, to the extent possible: • The study design • The definition of progression • The SAP • The methodology for handling missing data and censoring methods • The data to be recorded on the case report form (CRF) • The operating procedures of an independent endpoint review committee (IRC), if applicable (see Appendix) E. C linical Trial Analysis Issues Missing data can complicate endpoint analysis. For endpoints based on tumor assessments, the protocol should define an adequate assessment visit for each patient (i.e., a visit when all scheduled tumor assessments have been done). The analysis plan should outline a comparison of the adequacy of follow-up in each treatment arm. Methodology for analyzing incomplete and/or missing follow-up visits and censoring methods should be specified in the protocol. The analysis plan should specify the"}

Methodology for analyzing incomplete and/or missing follow-up visits and censoring methods should be specified in the protocol. The analysis plan should specify the primary analysis and one or more sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the results. Although any analyses with missing data can be problematic, the results can be strengthened by similar results in both the primary and the sensitivity analyses. When applicable, the evaluation should include the number of deaths in patients who have been lost to follow-up for a prolonged time period. For example, an imbalance in such deaths could bias a PFS measurement by overestimating PFS in the treatment arm with less follow-up. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 15 V. CONCLUSION Although the general principles outlined in this guidance should help applicants select endpoints for marketing applications, we recommend that applicants meet with the FDA before submitting protocols intended to support NDA or BLA marketing applications. The FDA will ensure that these meetings include a multidisciplinary FDA team of oncologists, statisticians, clinical pharmacologists, and external expert consultants as needed. Applicants can submit protocols after these meetings and request a special protocol assessment that provides confirmation of the acceptability of endpoints and protocol design to support drug marketing applications. 24 Ultimately, of course, marketing approval depends not only on the design of clinical trials, but on FDA review of the results and data from all studies in the drug marketing application. 24 See the guidance for industry Special Protocol Assessment. Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 16 APPENDIX: INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF TUMOR ENDPOINTS Clinical trial results that support drug approval should be verifiable by applicants and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Objective response rate (ORR) determined in single-arm studies can be evaluated by reviewing a limited number of images. When drug approval is based on measurement of progression-free survival (PFS), careful planning can minimize bias and enable the applicant and the FDA to verify results. An independent endpoint review committee (IRC) can minimize bias in radiographic interpretation of the radiological findings and independent adjudication of assessments. A clearly written plan of the charter outlining the IRC function and process (independent review charter) should be in place before initiation of the study. The plan should describe the assurance of the committee’s independence and procedure for collection, storage, and transportation of the results. The charter also should include the resolution of differences in interpretation and incorporation of clinical data in the final interpretation of data and audit procedures. The use of an IRC is discussed further in the guidance for industry Developing Medical Imaging Drug and Biological Products, Part 3: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Clinical Studies."}

It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. I. INTRODUCTION This document provides guidance to sponsors and applicants submitting investigational drug applications (INDs), new drug applications (NDAs), biologics licensing applications (BLAs), or supplemental applications on the appropriate use of non-inferiority (NI) study designs to provide evidence of the effectiveness of a drug or biologic, usually because a superiority study design (drug versus placebo, dose response, or superiority to an active drug) cannot be used. 2 The guidance gives advice on when NI studies intended to demonstrate effectiveness of an investigational drug can provide interpretable results, how to choose the NI margin, and how to test the NI hypothesis. This guidance does not provide recommendations for the use of NI study designs to evaluate the safety of a drug. In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidance documents means suggested or recommended, but not required. This guidance finalizes the draft guidance for industry, Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials, published in 2010. In addition, it supersedes the guidance for industry, Antibacterial Drug Products: Use of Noninferiority Trials to Support Approval, also published in 2010, which will be withdrawn. 1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Biostatistics and the Office of New Drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the Food and Drug Administration. 2 For the purposes of this guidance, all references to drugs include both human drugs and therapeutic biologic products unless otherwise specified. While most concepts discussed will be broadly applicable, certain issues related to vaccines, such as the choice of the NI margin when the study endpoint is the level of antibodies, would call for consultation from CBER. 2 II. BACKGROUND FDA’s regulations on adequate and well-controlled studies (21 CFR 314.126) describe four kinds of concurrently controlled trials that provide evidence of effectiveness. Three of them — placebo, no treatment, and dose-response controlled trials — are superiority trials that seek to show that a test drug is superior to the control (placebo, no treatment, or a lower dose of the test drug). The fourth kind, comparison with an active treatment (active control), can also be a superiority trial, if the intent is to show that the new drug is more effective than the control. More commonly, however, the goal of such studies is to show that the difference between the new and active control treatment is small — small enough to allow the known effectiveness of the active control, based on its performance in past studies and the assumed effectiveness of the active control in the current study, to support the conclusion that the new test drug is also effective.

The fourth kind, comparison with an active treatment (active control), can also be a superiority trial, if the intent is to show that the new drug is more effective than the control. More commonly, however, the goal of such studies is to show that the difference between the new and active control treatment is small — small enough to allow the known effectiveness of the active control, based on its performance in past studies and the assumed effectiveness of the active control in the current study, to support the conclusion that the new test drug is also effective. How to design and interpret the results of such studies so that they can support a conclusion about effectiveness of the new drug is challenging. Active controlled trials that are not intended to show superiority of the test drug but rather to show that the new treatment is not inferior to an unacceptable extent were once called clinical equivalence trials. The intent of an NI trial, however, is not to show that the new drug is equivalent, but rather that it is not materially worse than the control. Therefore, the interest is one-sided. The new drug could be better than the control, and therefore at a minimum non- inferior, but it would not be equivalent. The critical difference between superiority and NI trials is that a properly designed and conducted superiority trial, if successful in showing a difference, is entirely interpretable without further assumptions (other than lack of bias) — that is, the result speaks for itself and requires no extra-study information. In contrast, the NI study is dependent on knowing something that is not measured in the study, namely, that the active control had its expected effect in the NI study. When this occurs, the trial is said to have assay sensitivity, defined as the ability to have shown a difference from placebo of a specified size. A “successful” NI trial, one that shows what appears to be an acceptably small difference between treatments, may or may not have had assay sensitivity and therefore may or may not support a conclusion that the test drug was effective. Thus, if the active control had no effect at all in the NI trial (i.e., did not have any of its expected effect), then even ruling out a very small difference between control and test drug is meaningless and provides no evidence that the test drug is effective. (See Section III.D. for further discussion on assay sensitivity.) In the absence of a placebo arm, knowing whether the trial had assay sensitivity relies heavily on external (not within-study) information, giving NI studies some of the characteristics of a historically controlled trial. FDA regulations have recognized since 1985 the critical need to know, for an NI trial to be interpretable, that the active control had its expected effect in the trial. Thus, 21 CFR 314.126(a)(2)(iv), unchanged since 1985, says: If the intent of the trial is to show similarity of the test and control drugs, the report of the study should assess the ability of the study to have detected a difference between treatments. Similarity of test drug and active control can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was effective. The analysis of the study should explain why the 3 drugs should be considered effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous placebo-controlled studies of the active control drug. This guidance consists of four parts: • A general discussion of regulatory, study design, scientific, and statistical issues associated with the use of NI studies to establish the effectiveness of a new drug • A focus on some of these issues in more detail, notably the statistical approaches used to determine the NI margin and to test for non-inferiority • Commonly asked questions about NI studies • Four examples of successful and unsuccessful efforts to define NI margins and test for non-inferiority3 III. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-INFERIORITY STUDIES A. The Non-Inferiority Hypothesis In a placebo-controlled trial, the null hypothesis (H o) is that the beneficial response to the test drug (T) is less than or equal to the response to the placebo (P); the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is that the response to the test drug is greater than P. Thus: H o: T ≤ P; T – P ≤ 0 Ha: T > P; T – P > 0 In most cases, the test for a treatment effect corresponds to showing that the lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (equivalent to the lower bound of a one-sided 97.5% confidence interval) for T-P is > 0. This result shows that the effect of the test drug is greater than 0 (see Figure 1). 3 References: In this guidance, references to methods or studies are not included in the text; rather they are included in the general references section in the Appendix and are grouped by topic.

Possible Results of a Placebo-Controlled Superiority Study (Point Estimate and 95% Confidence Interval (CI)) Test – Placebo (T-P) 1. Point estimate of effect is 2; 95% CI lower bound is 1. Conclusion: Drug is effective and has an effect of at least 1. 2. Point estimate of effect is 2; 95% CI lower bound is <0. Conclusion: Drug is not shown to be effective. 3. Point estimate of effect is 0; 95% CI lower bound is well below 0. Conclusion: Drug is not shown to be effective. Although there is no difference in the conclusions of scenarios 2 and 3, the magnitude of the treatment difference and width of the confidence interval in scenario 2 may encourage the conduct of another study (possibly larger) before deciding that the test drug has no effect. In an NI study, the goal is to demonstrate that the test drug has an effect by showing that its effect is sufficiently close to the effect of an active control. There is no placebo arm in the study; therefore, the effect of the active control is not measured in the study but must be assumed. The goal of the study is to show that the effect of the test drug (T) is not inferior to the effect of the active control (C) by a specified amount, called the NI margin, or M. The null and alternative hypotheses correspond to a null hypothesis of inferiority and an alternative hypothesis of non-inferiority, as follows: Ho: C – T ≥ M (T is inferior to the control (C) by M or more) Ha: C – T < M (T is inferior to the control (C) by less than M) 5 A statistical test of the above hypothesis is provided by comparing the upper bound of the two- sided confidence interval for C-T with the NI margin, M, which is specified in advance. If the upper bound is less than M, non-inferiority of T relative to C is established. One choice for M (the largest possible value) is to set it equal to the entire known effect of the active control relative to placebo, based on past randomized controlled trials. With this choice for M, called M 1, and assuming the control drug attains this level of efficacy in the NI study, a finding of non-inferiority means that the test drug has an effect greater than 0 (see Figure 2). A more usual choice is to set M equal to some clinically relevant portion of M1, namely, the portion of the control drug effect it is important to preserve with the test drug, based on clinical judgment. 6 Figure 2. Possible Results of an NI Study Showing Control Drug–Test Drug Differences (Point Estimate and 95% CI) Control – Test (C-T) 1. Point estimate of C-T is 0, suggesting equal effect of C and T; upper bound of the 95% CI for C-T is 1, well below M1; NI is demonstrated. 2. Point estimate of C-T favors C; the upper bound of the 95% CI for C-T is >2, above M1; NI is not demonstrated. 3. Point estimate of C-T is zero, which suggests an equal effect; but the upper bound of the 95% CI for C-T is >2 (i.e., above M1), so that NI is not demonstrated. 4. Point estimate favors T; NI is demonstrated, but superiority is not demonstrated. 5. Point estimate favors T; superiority and NI are demonstrated. 6. Point estimate of C-T is 1, favoring the control. The upper bound of the 95% CI for C-T is <M1, demonstrating NI (the entire effect of C has not been lost) but at the same time the 95% CI for C-T is above zero, indicating that T is actually inferior to C, even while meeting the NI standard. The determination of M 1 is a critical step in designing an NI trial and is often difficult; this determination is therefore a major focus of this guidance. M1 cannot be directly measured in the NI study, because there is no concurrent placebo group. It must be estimated based on the past performance of the active control, preferably in placebo-controlled trials, and then assumed to hold for the NI study based on a comparison of prior test conditions to the current test environment (see section III.D). 7 The choice of the margin M1 has important practical consequences. The smaller the margin, the lower the upper bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval for C-T must be, and the larger the sample size needed to establish non-inferiority. Showing that the upper bound of the 95% CI of C-T is less than M1 demonstrates that the test drug has some effect"}

Showing that the upper bound of the 95% CI of C-T is less than M1 demonstrates that the test drug has some effect (i.e., an effect > 0). The margin of interest, however, as noted above, is usually smaller than M1 (to show that an adequate portion of the clinical benefit of the control is preserved), in which case it is called M2. The basis for this expectation is described below in section III.C.4. B. Reasons for Using a Non-Inferiority Design The usual reason for using an NI active control study design instead of a superiority design is an ethical one. Specifically, this design is chosen when it would not be ethical to use a placebo, or a no-treatment control, or a very low dose of an active drug, because there is an effective treatment that provides an important benefit (e.g., life-saving or preventing irreversible injury) available to patients for the condition to be studied in the trial. Whether a placebo control can be used depends on the nature of the benefits provided by available therapy. The International Conference on Harmonisation guidance E10: Choice of Control Group and Related Issues in Clinical Trials (ICH E10) states: In cases where an available treatment is known to prevent serious harm, such as death or irreversible morbidity in the study population, it is generally inappropriate to use a placebo control. There are occasional exemptions, however, such as cases in which standard therapy has toxicity so severe that many patients have refused to receive it. In other situations, where there is no serious harm, it is generally considered ethical to ask patients to participate in a placebo-controlled trial, even if they may experience discomfort as a result, provided the setting is non-coercive and patients are fully informed about available therapies and the consequences of delaying treatment [ICH E10; pps.13- 14]. Aside from this ethical reason, there may be other reasons to include an active control, possibly in conjunction with a placebo control, either to compare treatments or to assess assay sensitivity (see section III.D). Caregivers, third party payers, and some regulatory authorities have increasingly placed an emphasis on the comparative effectiveness of treatments, leading to more studies that compare two treatments. Such studies can provide information about the clinical basis for comparative effectiveness claims, which may be helpful in assessing cost effectiveness of treatments. If a placebo group is included in addition to the active comparator, it becomes possible to judge whether the study could have distinguished treatments that differed substantially, e.g., active drug versus placebo. Such comparative effectiveness studies must be distinguished from NI studies, which are the main focus of this document. The word non- inferior is used here in a special sense. The methods described in this document are intended to show that a new treatment that demonstrates non-inferiority is effective, not that it is as effective as the active comparator. A new treatment may meet the standard of effectiveness (that it is superior to placebo) without justifying a conclusion that it is as effective or even nearly as effective as the active comparator. 8 C. The Non-Inferiority Margin As described above, the NI study seeks to show that the amount by which the test drug (T) is inferior to the active control (C), C-T, is less than some prespecified NI margin (M). M can be no larger than the presumed entire effect of the active control in the NI study, and the margin based on the entire active control effect is generally referred to as M 1. It is critical to recognize that M1 is not measured in the NI trial (in the absence of a placebo arm), but rather is estimated based on past performance of the active control. The effect is assumed to be present in the current study based on a thorough comparison of the characteristics of the current NI study with those of prior studies and assessment of the quality of the NI study. The validity of any conclusion from the NI study depends on the choice of M1 and its relevance to the current NI study. If, for example, the NI margin is chosen as 10, and the study does indeed rule out a difference of 10 (but not a smaller difference), seeming to demonstrate effectiveness of T, but the true effect of C in this study was actually less than 10, then a conclusion that the study demonstrated non-inferiority would have been incorrect. The choice of M 1, together with reasonable assurance that this effect occurred in the trial (i.e., the presence of assay sensitivity), is thus critical to obtaining a meaningful, correct answer in an NI"}

The choice of M 1, together with reasonable assurance that this effect occurred in the trial (i.e., the presence of assay sensitivity), is thus critical to obtaining a meaningful, correct answer in an NI study. Because assay sensitivity can never be proven in the absence of a placebo group, historical evidence of assay sensitivity is essential, but measures should be taken to make it likely that the active control will have the presumed effect in the NI study (see section III.A.5). This, together with careful selection of the NI margin, will increase the likelihood of valid and interpretable results. Because the consequence of choosing a margin greater than the actual treatment effect of the active control in the study may be a false conclusion that a new drug is effective, an undesirable public health outcome, there is a powerful tendency to be conservative both in the choice of margin and in the statistical analysis used to rule out a degree of inferiority of the test drug to the active control of more than that margin. This is generally done by ensuring that the upper bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval for C-T in the NI trial is smaller than M1. Use of this interval corresponds to a one-sided test size (alpha level) of 0.025 in testing the NI hypothesis stated above. The upper bound of the confidence interval for C-T is not, however, the only measurement of interest, just as the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval for the effect of drug versus placebo in a superiority trial is not the only value of relevance. The point estimate of the treatment effect and the width of its confidence interval are also relevant. Nonetheless, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval is typically used to judge the effectiveness of the test drug in the NI study, just as a two-sided test size (alpha level) of 0.05 is traditionally the standard used for defining success in a superiority trial. The 95% confidence interval upper bound for C- T is used, in conjunction with M 1, to provide a reasonably high level of assurance that the test drug does, in fact, have an effect greater than zero (i.e., ruling out loss of all the effect of the active control). Although the NI margin used in a trial can be no larger than the entire assumed effect of the active control in the NI study (M 1), it is usual and generally desirable to choose a smaller value, called M2, for the NI margin. Showing non-inferiority to M1 would provide assurance that the test drug had an effect greater than zero, but in many cases that would not be sufficient to conclude that the test drug had a clinically acceptable effect. Recall that the main reason an NI study is conducted is that it is not ethical to include a placebo arm. The active control has a 9 beneficial effect, and denying that benefit to subjects with a serious illness is not ethical. For the same reason, it would not usually be acceptable for a test drug to lose most of that active control’s effect. It is therefore usual in NI studies to choose a smaller margin (M2) that reflects the largest loss of effect that would be clinically acceptable. This can be described as an absolute difference in effect (typical of antibiotic trials) or as a fraction of the risk reduction provided by the control (typical in cardiovascular outcome trials). Note that a larger value for M2 may be justified clinically, if the test drug were shown to have some important advantage (e.g., on safety or on a secondary endpoint). Concern has been expressed that use of M 2 represents an FDA “comparative effectiveness” standard that is not included in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In explaining the role of relative effectiveness under law in April 1995, President Clinton and Vice President Gore (“Reinventing Regulation of Drugs and Medical Devices,” part of the National Performance Review) stated the following: In certain circumstances, however, it may be important to consider whether a new product is less effective than available alternative therapies, when less effectiveness could present a danger to the patient or to the public. For example, it is essential for public health protection that a new therapy be as effective as alternatives that are already approved for marketing when: 1. the disease to be treated is life-threatening or capable of causing irreversible morbidity (e.g., stroke or heart attack); or 2. the disease to be treated is a contagious illness that poses serious consequences to the health of others (e.g., sexually transmitted disease).

The reinvention statement was placed in the Federal Register of August 1, 1995 (60 FR 39180 at 39181), as an FDA position by FDA’s Deputy Commissioner for Policy, William Schultz. The definitions used to describe these two versions of M are: M 1 = the entire effect of the active control assumed to be present in the NI study M2 = the largest clinically acceptable difference (degree of inferiority) of the test drug compared to the active control M 1 is estimated based on the historical experience with the active control drug. Its relevance to the current NI trial is based on: 1. Assessment of the likelihood that the current effect of the active control is similar to that observed in the past studies used to estimate the active control effect (the constancy assumption) 2. Assessment of the quality of the NI trial, particularly looking for deficiencies in study design and/or conduct that could reduce a difference between the active control and the new drug Note that in a trial seeking to show a difference (i.e., superiority), this diminution of the between- treatment difference in the second element is a “bias toward the null,” but in a non-inferiority 10 trial, it is a “bias toward the alternative” (i.e., non-inferiority). Because of this second element, in some situations M1, although prespecified, has to be “discounted” (i.e., a smaller value would be used), but the amount of discounting needed may not be known until the NI study has been completed. The choice of M2 is a matter of clinical judgment, but M2 can never be greater than M1, even for a situation in which the active control drug has a small effect, and clinical judgment might argue that a larger difference is not clinically important. Even if that clinical judgment were reasonable, choosing an M2 greater than M1 as the NI margin would not allow a conclusion that the test drug has any effect. As explained above, ruling out a difference between the active control and test drug larger than M1 is the critical finding that supports a conclusion of effectiveness. This analysis is approached with great rigor; that is, a difference (C-T) larger than M1 needs to be ruled out with a high degree of statistical assurance. As M2 represents a clinical judgment, there may be a greater flexibility in interpreting a 95% upper bound for C-T that is slightly greater than M2, as long as the upper bound is still well less than M1 (see Figure 3). 11 Figure 3. Possible Results of an NI Study Showing Active Control – Test Drug Differences (Point Estimate and 95% CI) Control – Test (C-T); (degree of inferiority of test drug) 1. C-T point estimate = 0 and upper bound of 95% CI < M2, indicating test drug is effective and adequately rules out an unacceptable loss of the control effect (NI demonstrated). 2. Point estimate of C-T favors C; upper bound of 95% CI < M1 but > M2, indicating test drug effect > 0 but an unacceptable loss of the control effect has not been ruled out. 3. Point estimate of C-T is zero and upper bound of 95% CI < M1 but it is slightly greater than M2. Loss of the pre-specified M2 has thus not been ruled out, but whether the study has shown adequate preservation of the control effect would be a matter of clinical judgment. 4. C-T point estimate favors C and upper bound of 95% CI > M1, indicating the study does not provide evidence of effectiveness for test drug. D. Assay Sensitivity Assay sensitivity is an essential property of an NI clinical trial. Assay sensitivity is the ability of the trial to have detected a difference between treatments of a specified size. Stated in another way, assay sensitivity means that had the study included a placebo, a control drug-placebo difference of at least M 1 would have been present. 12 As explained above, the choice of M1, and the conclusion that a trial has assay sensitivity (i.e., the active control would have had an effect of at least M1), is based on three considerations: 1. Historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects 2. The similarity of the new NI trial to the historical trials (the constancy assumption) 3. The quality of the new trial (ruling out defects that would tend to minimize differences between treatments) 1.

Historical evidence of sensitivity to drug effects 2. The similarity of the new NI trial to the historical trials (the constancy assumption) 3. The quality of the new trial (ruling out defects that would tend to minimize differences between treatments) 1. Historical Evidence of Sensitivity to Drug Effects (HESDE) HESDE means that prior studies, which were appropriately designed and conducted trials in the past and that used a specific active treatment (generally the one that is to be used in the new NI study or, in some cases, one or more pharmacologically closely related drugs), regularly showed this treatment to be superior to placebo (or some other treatment). Consistent findings in past studies allow for a reliable estimate of the drug’s effect compared to placebo. The estimate of the size of the effect must take the variability of past results into account; one should not presume that the largest effect seen in any trial, or even the point estimate of a meta-analysis of all relevant trials, is certain to be repeated. Analysis of historical data will be discussed further in section IV. HESDE cannot be determined for many symptomatic treatments (e.g., treatments for depression, anxiety, insomnia, angina, symptomatic heart failure, symptoms of irritable bowel disease, and pain), as even well-designed and conducted studies for such indications often fail to distinguish an effective drug from placebo. In those cases, it cannot be assumed that an active control would have shown superiority to a placebo (had there been one) in any given NI study, and NI studies of drugs for these indications may therefore be non-informative. These issues can also negatively affect the assessment of effectiveness in outcome studies. For example, in the case of aspirin, the largest placebo-controlled trial (AMIS, the Aspirin Myocardial Infarction Study; see Example 2) did not show an effect of aspirin even though other trials all favored aspirin. Similarly, of more than 30 post-infarction beta-blocker trials, only a small number showed significantly improved survival or other cardiovascular benefit. 2. Similarity of the Current NI Trial to the Historical Studies and Its Relationship to the “Constancy Assumption” The conclusion that HESDE can be used to estimate the effect of the active control, which will then serve as the basis for choosing M 1 for the new NI study, can be reached only when it is appropriate to conclude that the NI study is sufficiently similar to the past studies with respect to all important study design and conduct features that might influence the active control effect. This conclusion is referred to as the “constancy assumption.” The design features of interest include: • The characteristics of the patient population • Important concomitant treatments • Definitions and ascertainment of study endpoints • Dose of active control 13 • Entry criteria • Analytic approaches For example, the effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on heart failure mortality has repeatedly been shown in studies where the drugs were added to diuretics and (frequently) digoxin, establishing HESDE, but evolution in treatment since those studies were conducted raises questions about our understanding of the present-day effect of ACE inhibitors. Since the time of those studies, other medications (beta blockers, spironolactone) have come into standard use. We do not know whether the past effect would still be present when ACE inhibitors are added to a regimen including drugs from these two classes. Similarly, the effect of a thrombolytic on cardiovascular mortality could depend on how soon after symptoms the drug was given, concomitant use of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitors, and use of lipid-lowering drugs. To provide a sound basis for choosing M 1, the historical studies and the new NI study should be as nearly identical as possible in all important respects. Providing reasonable assurance that endpoints in the historical trial will be similar to, and will have been evaluated similarly to, endpoints in the new trial is easier when the endpoints are standardized and objective. The effect of the active control could be on a single endpoint (e.g., mortality) or on a composite (e.g., death, heart attack, and stroke), but, again, it is critical that measurement and assessment of these be reasonably consistent over time. The endpoint used in the NI study need not necessarily be the one used in the original trials of the active control if data from the historical studies are available to estimate the size of the effect of the active control on the new endpoint used in the NI study. For example, even if the historical studies used a mortality endpoint, the studies could be used, if high quality data could be obtained, to calculate the magnitude of an effect for an endpoint of death plus hospitalization, as long as it was possible to be confident that the circumstances leading to the hospitalization were similar in the historical studies and the NI study. Note, however, that it would not be acceptable to search through a range of endpoints"}

Note, however, that it would not be acceptable to search through a range of endpoints to find the largest historical effect, as this could represent an overestimate of the effect to be expected in the NI study. In general, where there has been substantial evolution over time in disease definition and treatment, or where the methodology used in the historical trials has become outdated, the assumption of constancy may not be supported, and, therefore, the use of an NI design may not be justified. Although an NI study can be designed to be similar in most aspects to the historical studies, it may not be possible to assess that similarity fully until the NI study is completed and various characteristics of the study population and response are evaluated. When there is known heterogeneity of the active control treatment effect related to patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, severity) and that heterogeneity can be quantified, it may be necessary to adjust the estimate of the size of the active control effect in the NI study if the mix of patient characteristics in the historical studies and the NI study differ substantially. The property of constancy of the treatment effect may depend on which metric is chosen to represent the treatment effect. This issue is discussed in more depth in section IV.B.2.c. Experience suggests that when background rates of outcome events differ among study 14 populations, metrics like hazard ratio or relative risk may be more stable than metrics like absolute risk difference, which are more sensitive to changes in event rates in the population. 3. Good Study Quality Conducting any poor quality studies should always be avoided, but with NI studies, sloppiness in study design/conduct is particularly problematic, because it introduces bias towards the alternative hypothesis of non-inferiority (see ICH E10; pp. 11-12 and section IV.F for further discussion). Deficiencies such as imprecise or poorly implemented entry criteria, poor compliance, use of concomitant treatments whose effects may overlap with the drugs under study, inadequate measurement techniques, errors in delivering assigned treatments, high attrition, or poor follow-up may reduce the difference C-T observed in the study, potentially leading to a false conclusion of non-inferiority. It should also be appreciated that intent-to-treat approaches, which preserve the principle that all patients are analyzed according to the treatment to which they have been randomized even if they do not receive it, although conservative in superiority trials, are not necessarily conservative in an NI study and can lead to an incorrect finding of non-inferiority. In a superiority trial, sloppiness can lead to study failure. In contrast, poor quality in an NI trial can sometimes lead to an apparent finding of non-inferiority that is incorrect. Therefore, particular attention to quality is critical when planning and conducting an NI study. Adjustment for poor quality after the fact is usually not possible. E. Statistical Inference The various approaches to calculating the NI margin and analyzing an NI study will be discussed in detail in section IV. A commonly used fixed margin method is generally referred to as the 95%-95% method. The first 95% refers to the confidence interval of the estimated effect of the control based on the historical studies demonstrating the effect, and the second 95% refers to the confidence interval used to test the null hypothesis in the NI study. Note that the first 95% lower confidence bound discussed here is a bound for the average effect of the active comparator in historical studies, or the true effect in the NI study if the constancy assumption holds. It is sometimes supposed that this is a lower bound for the actual effect of the comparator in the NI study, and the draft guidance (issued in 2010) suggests this, but this is not correct. The 95% lower bound does indeed define a lower bound for the true control effect, but the actual effect in the NI study would still be liable to sampling variation. To bound the actual effect, a different type of interval would be required; these intervals are known as prediction intervals and are much wider than the corresponding confidence intervals. Confidence intervals nevertheless suffice for the present purpose, because the confidence interval from the historical studies bounds the true effect of the comparator relative to placebo, and the confidence interval from the NI study bounds the true effect of the test drug relative to the comparator. Relying always on the constancy assumption, these can be combined to infer a positive effect of the test drug relative to placebo. The 95%-95% fixed margin approach (using in this case a risk difference rather than"}

Relying always on the constancy assumption, these can be combined to infer a positive effect of the test drug relative to placebo. The 95%-95% fixed margin approach (using in this case a risk difference rather than a risk ratio for the margin) can be illustrated by FDA’s evaluation of a new thrombolytic product, reteplase, 15 for treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To calculate the NI margin, results of all available placebo-controlled trials of streptokinase, the active comparator (control) for the NI study, were pooled by means of an appropriate meta-analytic method. The pooled results provided a point estimate for the effect on survival of an absolute 2.6% difference in mortality rates, with a 95% lower bound of 2.1% (i.e., M 1). A clinical decision was made that any new thrombolytic should rule out a loss of more than half of the benefit of streptokinase to be regarded as an acceptable alternative. The NI study would therefore have had to rule out an absolute 1.05% increase in mortality rate (i.e., M 2) in the reteplase-treated patients compared to those treated with streptokinase. The NI analysis for this study was to show that the 95% confidence interval (one-sided for this particular case) of the difference in mortality rates excluded an increase of 1.05%. The INJECT study accomplished this, and the product was approved for marketing. An alternative to the fixed margin approach is known as the synthesis approach because it combines or synthesizes the data from the historical trials and the current NI trial, reflecting the variability in both data sources. Although the 95%-95% method was developed in a different way, it has been noted that it can be viewed as mathematically equivalent to the synthesis method but with the standard error of the effect of the test drug relative to placebo, estimated by 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐻𝐻 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 , where SE H and SEN are the standard errors from the historical studies and the NI study, respectively, rather than by �𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 2 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 2 , which is the standard error for the synthesis method. The first formula always gives a larger standard error than the second. Thus, compared to the synthesis method, the 95%-95% method is conservative. Both methods rely crucially on the assumption of constant effect of the control (on average) between the historical studies and the NI study. The use of the 95%-95% method might be seen as an allowance for possible deviation from this assumption, a desirable feature for evaluating whether loss of M 1 (the whole effect of the control) has been ruled out. Use of the synthesis method, along with a careful justification of the constancy assumption and, when appropriate, an explicit allowance for deviation from it, would also be acceptable and may be recommended for determining whether a loss of effect greater than M 2 has been ruled out (see Section IV.C and Example 1(B) for more detail). F. Regulatory Conclusions A successful NI study shows rigorously that the test drug has an effect greater than zero if it excludes an NI margin of M 1, as long as M1 is well chosen and represents an effect that the control drug actually would have had (versus a placebo, had there been a placebo group). The NI study can also be used to show that the test drug had an effect greater than some fraction of the control drug effect, depending on the M 2 that is used. Note, however, that although a successful NI study supports effectiveness of the test drug, it will only rarely support a conclusion that the drug is “equivalent” or “similar” to the active control, a concept that has not 16 been well defined for these situations. It should be appreciated that in addition to the rigorous demonstration of effectiveness based on significance testing, the trial provides additional information, just as a placebo-controlled trial supporting the effectiveness of a drug does. The point estimate of the drug effect and its confidence interval provide information about how large the difference between the test and control drug is likely to be. As noted before, a successful NI study will usually not be sufficient to support a conclusion that the test drug is equivalent or similar to the active control. The methods discussed in this document, especially with regard to choosing the margin, are not intended to demonstrate equivalence or similarity but only to show that the test drug is effective. However, if the lower bound of the confidence interval for the effect of the test drug relative to the active control were only slightly negative, a judgment that similarity had been shown would be possible. If studies are intended to support equivalence, the margin against which the confidence"}

If studies are intended to support equivalence, the margin against which the confidence interval is to be judged should be justified in advance, and the margin will usually be smaller than M 2. G. Alternative Designs ICH E10 identifies a wide variety of study designs that may be better than an NI design in situations where there is difficulty or uncertainty in setting the NI margin or where the NI margin needs to be so small that the NI study sample size becomes impossibly large. 1. Add-on Study In many cases, for a pharmacologically novel treatment, the most interesting question is not whether it is effective alone but whether the new drug can add to the effectiveness of treatments that are already available. The most pertinent study would therefore be a comparison of the new agent and placebo, each added to established therapy. Thus, new treatments for heart failure have added new agents (e.g., ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and spironolactone) to diuretics and digoxin. As each new agent became established, it became part of the background therapy to which any new agent and placebo would be added. This approach is also typical in oncology, in the treatment of seizure disorders, and, in many cases, in the treatment of AIDS. 2. Identifying a Population Not Known to Benefit From Available Therapy in Which a Placebo-Controlled Trial Is Acceptable In many outcome study settings, effectiveness is established for some clinical settings (e.g., severe disease) but not others. Therefore, it may be possible to study less severely ill patients in placebo-controlled trials. The demonstration that simvastatin was effective in hypercholesterolemic post-infarction patients (4S), for example, did not preclude studies of statins in hypercholesterolemic non-infarction patients (WOSCOPS) or in patients with lesser degrees of hypercholesterolemia (TEXCAPS). This approach is appropriate as long as there is uncertainty as to whether the treatment is of value in the new study population. It may also be possible to study patients intolerant to the known effective therapy. For example, it was possible to study angiotensin receptor blockers in a placebo-controlled trial in heart failure patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors, but it would not have been possible to deny a more general 17 population of heart failure patients an ACE inhibitor, as it had already been established that ACE inhibitors improved survival in a general heart failure population. 3. Early Escape, Rescue Treatment, Randomized Withdrawal In symptomatic conditions, there may be reluctance to leave people on placebo for prolonged periods when effective therapy exists. It is possible to incorporate early escape/rescue provisions for patients who do not respond by a particular time, or to use a design that terminates patients on first recurrence of a symptom such as unstable angina, grand mal seizure, or paroxysmal supra-ventricular tachycardia. To evaluate the persistence of effects over time, where conducting a long-term placebo-controlled trial would be difficult, a randomized withdrawal study can be used. In these studies, patients successfully treated with a drug are randomly assigned to placebo or continued drug treatment. As soon as symptoms return, the patient is considered to have had an endpoint. H. Number of Studies Needed Ordinarily, with exceptions allowed by the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 (the Modernization Act), FDA expects that there will be more than one adequate and well-controlled study supporting effectiveness. The Modernization Act allows one study plus confirmatory evidence to serve as substantial evidence in some cases, and FDA has issued a guidance that discusses when a single study might be sufficient. 2 Where there is uncertainty about the magnitude of the historical treatment effect (and thus M 1) because of variability or reliance on a single historical study, more than one NI study is usually needed to support effectiveness. Where the studies are of relatively modest size, there is usually no impediment to conducting more than one NI trial if that appears necessary. Conducting two trials that are very large (to have adequate statistical power), however, may be infeasible, and it is worth considering what might make a single trial persuasive. Generally, two considerations might do so: (1) availability of other relevant information and (2) a statistically persuasive result. 1. Other Relevant Information In NI trials, the test drug is generally pharmacologically similar to the active control (i.e., if they were not pharmacologically similar, an add-on study would usually have been more persuasive and more practical). In these cases, the expectation of similar performance (but still requiring confirmation in a trial) might make it possible to accept a single trial and perhaps could also 2 See the guidance for industry Providing Clinical Evidence of"}

A similar conclusion might be reached when other types of data are available, for example: • If there were a very persuasive biomarker confirming similar activity of the test drug and active control (e.g., tumor response, ACE inhibition, or extent of beta blockade) • If the drug has been shown to be effective in closely related clinical settings (e.g., effective as adjunctive therapy with an NI study of monotherapy) • If the drug has been shown to be effective in distinct but related populations (e.g., adult versus pediatric) 2. Statistically Persuasive Result A conclusion that an NI trial can be considered statistically persuasive may be based on the internal consistency of the NI finding or on the margin that is ruled out with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. It is important to recognize that there are two margins of interest, M 1 and M2. In an NI study, the clinically determined margin M2 is smaller, often considerably smaller, than M1, which is used to determine whether the test drug has any effect. For example, M2 might be chosen to be 40% of M1. By meeting this M2 criterion, ruling out a loss of 40% of the effect of the control, a single NI study provides reasonable assurance that the test drug preserves a clinically sufficient fraction (at least 60%) of the effect of the control treatment. At the same time, it provides strong assurance that the test drug has an effect greater than zero. In such cases, a single trial would usually be a sufficient basis for approval. Where the preservation of effect is particularly critical, of course, demonstrating that loss of M2 has been ruled out in more than one study might be considered necessary. In some cases, a study planned as an NI study may show superiority to the active control. Recommendations in International Conference on Harmonisation guidance E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials (ICH E9) and FDA policy have been that this superiority finding arising in an NI study can be interpreted without adjustment for multiplicity. Showing superiority to an active control is a very persuasive demonstration of the effectiveness of the test drug, because demonstrating superiority to an active drug is much more difficult than demonstrating superiority to placebo. Similarly, a finding of less than superiority, but with a 95% confidence interval upper bound for C-T considerably smaller than M 2, is also statistically persuasive for demonstrating effectiveness. I. Choice of Active Control The active control must be a drug whose effect is well-defined. The most obvious choice is a single drug for which historical placebo-controlled trials are available to define the active control effect assumed for the NI trial. When there are several pharmacologically similar drugs, it may be possible to use a combined analysis to choose an NI margin, and in that case, any one of the related drugs may be considered as the active control in the NI trial (see section IV.B.2.b). 19 IV. CHOOSING THE NON-INFERIORITY MARGIN AND TESTING THE NON- INFERIORITY HYPOTHESIS A. Introduction In this section, various sources of uncertainty that come into play for NI trials are discussed, with particular emphasis on those affecting the choice of margin. We also discuss in more detail the choice of statistical test for the NI hypothesis. As described briefly in section III, there are two different approaches to analysis of the NI study, one called the fixed margin method and the other called the synthesis method. Both use the same data from the historical studies and NI study, but in different ways. ● With the fixed margin method, the margin M 1 is based upon estimates of the effect of the active comparator in previously conducted studies. The NI margin to be ruled out in the NI study is then prespecified, and it is usually chosen as a quantity smaller than M1 (i.e., M2) to ensure that a reasonable fraction of the effect of the control is preserved. The NI study is successful if the results rule out with a sufficient level of confidence (e.g., 97.5%) inferiority of the test drug to the control by an amount equal to the NI margin or more.

The NI margin to be ruled out in the NI study is then prespecified, and it is usually chosen as a quantity smaller than M1 (i.e., M2) to ensure that a reasonable fraction of the effect of the control is preserved. The NI study is successful if the results rule out with a sufficient level of confidence (e.g., 97.5%) inferiority of the test drug to the control by an amount equal to the NI margin or more. It is referred to as a fixed margin method because the past studies comparing the control drug with placebo are used to derive a single fixed value for M 1. The value typically chosen is the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval about the treatment effect of a single placebo-controlled trial or meta- analysis of such trials and represents a conservative estimate of the effect the active control drug is expected to have in the NI study. If M1 is ruled out by the 95% confidence interval upper bound for C-T, then the conclusion is made that the test drug has an effect. If M2 is ruled out, then the effect of the test drug has been shown to preserve a clinically important fraction of the effect of the control drug. ● The synthesis method, derived from the same data, combines (or synthesizes) the estimate of treatment effect relative to the control from the NI trial with the estimate of the control effect from a meta-analysis of historical trials. This method treats both sources of data as if they came from the same randomized trial, to project what the placebo effect would have been had the placebo been present in the NI trial. The process makes use of the variability from both the NI trial and the historical trials and yields one confidence interval for testing the NI hypothesis that the treatment rules out loss of a prespecified fixed fraction of the control effect without actually specifying that control effect or a specific fixed NI margin based on the control effect. In other words, the fraction M 2/M1 of the control effect that is to be preserved in evaluating NI is specified in advance, but neither quantity (M1 or M2) is specified. The multiple steps involved and assumptions made in evaluating the NI hypothesis using either the fixed-margin or synthesis approach are all potential sources of uncertainty that may be introduced into the results and conclusions of an NI study. In section IV.B, we attempt to identify these sources and suggest approaches to accounting for uncertainty to reduce the possibility of drawing false conclusions from an NI study. Section IV.C provides further discussion of the statistical analysis methods for evaluating non-inferiority. 20 B. Statistical Uncertainties and Quantification of the Active Control Effect (M1) 1. What Are the Sources of Uncertainty in an NI Study? The interpretation of an NI study depends on three linked critical conclusions: 1. That there is reliable information about the effect the active control drug had in past studies 2. That there is reason to believe the effect the active control drug has in the current NI study is similar to the effect observed in past studies 3. That the NI study provides reliable information about the effect of the test drug relative to the comparator All three sources of information are subject to uncertainty. For the first and third, the uncertainty is largely of a statistical nature, measured by standard errors (for the synthesis method) and confidence intervals (for the fixed margin method). The second conclusion is subject to scientific uncertainty that is largely unquantifiable. The first source of uncertainty is the estimation of the effect of the active control in past studies. Particular problems arise when there is only a single historical study of the active control versus placebo because there is then no information about study-to-study variability; when there are multiple studies but substantial inconsistency in the estimates of the size of the effect among them; and when data from several pharmacologically related drugs are used to develop the estimate for the effect of the active control. All three of these potential problems need to be considered when choosing M 1. The second source of uncertainty is not statistically based but rather arises from the concern that the magnitude of effect estimated from past studies will be larger than the effect of the active control in the current NI study. Assuming that the effect will be unchanged is often referred to as the “constancy assumption.” If the assumption is incorrect and the magnitude of the effect in the current NI study is smaller than the estimated effect from historical studies, M 1 will have been incorrectly chosen (too large) and an apparently successful study showing NI could have given an erroneous result. Lack of constancy can occur for many reasons, including advances in adjunctive medical care, differences in the patient populations, or changes in the assessment of the endpoints under study. As discussed in section IV.B.2.c,"}

All three of these potential problems need to be considered when choosing M 1. The second source of uncertainty is not statistically based but rather arises from the concern that the magnitude of effect estimated from past studies will be larger than the effect of the active control in the current NI study. Assuming that the effect will be unchanged is often referred to as the “constancy assumption.” If the assumption is incorrect and the magnitude of the effect in the current NI study is smaller than the estimated effect from historical studies, M 1 will have been incorrectly chosen (too large) and an apparently successful study showing NI could have given an erroneous result. Lack of constancy can occur for many reasons, including advances in adjunctive medical care, differences in the patient populations, or changes in the assessment of the endpoints under study. As discussed in section IV.B.2.c, there is some experience to support the view that in cardiovascular outcome studies, the absolute size of the treatment effect is more likely to be variable and sensitive to the background rates in the control group than is the risk reduction. The risk reduction may thus be a more constant measure of control drug effect than the absolute effect. How to adjust the NI margin for concerns about constancy is inevitably a matter of judgment. The third source of uncertainty involves the risk of making a false conclusion based on the results of the test of the NI hypothesis in the NI study (i.e., concluding that C-T < M 1 when it is not). This uncertainty is referred to as the Type I error, or the false positive conclusion risk, and is similar to the concern in a placebo-controlled superiority trial that one might mistakenly conclude that a drug is more effective than placebo. It is, in other words, present in any 21 hypothesis-testing situation. In the NI case, the statistical test is intended to ensure that the difference between control and test drug (C-T, the degree of superiority of the control over the test drug) is smaller than the NI margin, meaning that some of the effect of the control is preserved (if C-T < M1) or that a sufficient amount is preserved (if C-T < M2). Typically, the one-sided Type I error is set at 0.025 by asking that the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for C-T be less than the NI margin; this is roughly similar to the usual statistical test of superiority in a placebo-controlled trial. If only one NI study is going to be conducted, the probability of a Type I error can be made smaller by requiring that the upper bound of a confidence interval greater than 95% (e.g., 99%) be calculated and be less than the margin. This approach is similar to what is a commonly done for a single placebo-controlled trial (e.g., testing at an alpha of 0.01 - 0.001 instead of 0.05). As noted earlier, however, there may be prior information that eases this concern, and a single study at the usual Type I error boundary (0.025) may be considered sufficient if, for example, the drug and active control are pharmacologically similar. In the following subsections, we elaborate on the impact of the first two sources of uncertainty as well as the choice of margin to use in hypothesis testing. 2. Quantification of the Active Control Effect Past controlled studies provide the empirical data for estimating the treatment effect of the active control. The magnitude of that treatment effect, which will be the basis for determining the control drug effect that can be assumed to be present in the NI study, is critical to determining whether conducting an NI study is feasible. If the active control has a small treatment effect, an effect only marginally distinguishable from placebo, or an inconsistent effect, an active controlled study designed to show non-inferiority is likely to require a very large sample size or may not be practical at all. The magnitude of the treatment effect of the active control may be determined in several ways, depending upon the amount of data and the number of separate studies of similar design available to support this determination. Having many independent historical studies is generally more informative than having only one or two, because the estimate of the active control effect can be more precise and less subject to uncertainty, and because it becomes possible to judge the constancy of the effect for at least the time period spanned by the studies. a. Determining HESDE from a single study The most common situation in which an NI design is used to demonstrate effectiveness involves outcome studies where the active control drug has been approved for use to reduce the risk of major events (e.g., death, stroke, heart attack, continued infection, or tumor progression). It is not unusual for such approval to have been based on a single study in a specific setting, although there may be other pertinent data in related conditions or in different populations, or with pharmacologically similar drugs. Generally, basing an NI margin on a single randomized placebo-controlled superiority study would need to take into account the variability of the data in that study. The estimate of the treatment effect is usually represented by some metric such as the difference between the event rate in the active treatment group and the placebo"}

It is not unusual for such approval to have been based on a single study in a specific setting, although there may be other pertinent data in related conditions or in different populations, or with pharmacologically similar drugs. Generally, basing an NI margin on a single randomized placebo-controlled superiority study would need to take into account the variability of the data in that study. The estimate of the treatment effect is usually represented by some metric such as the difference between the event rate in the active treatment group and the placebo control group, 22 which can be a difference in event rates or a risk ratio. The treatment effect has an uncertainty that is usually represented by the confidence interval. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval provides a conservative estimate of the effect the active control had in the historical study and can be assumed to have in a future NI study, recognizing the possibility that changes in practice could reduce the historical effect somewhat. It is critical that a conservative estimate of the effect of the active control be used as the basis of the NI margin, because the logic of the NI study depends on the assumption that the active control has an effect at least equal to M1 in the NI study. If the p-value of the estimated treatment effect is much smaller than 0.05, for instance in the range of 0.01 or 0.001 or even smaller, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval will generally be well above zero (in absolute value) or well below 1.0 (for hazard ratio and other risk estimates). In this case, we are more certain that the treatment effect is real and that the effect of the control in the NI study will be of reasonable size. When there is only a single placebo-controlled trial of the active control, there is no objective assessment of study-to-study variability of the treatment effect and, inevitably, there is concern about the level of assurance we can have that the control will have an effect of a particular size in the NI study. A potential cautious approach to account for this situation is to use the lower bound of a wider confidence interval, such as the 99% confidence interval. This approach is possible where the effect is very large, but will often yield an M 1 that necessitates a very large NI trial. It may be reassuring in these cases if closely related drugs, or the control drug in closely related diseases, have similar effects. A high level of internal consistency in subpopulations (e.g., if the effect of the control drug is similar in subgroups based on sex or age) could also provide some reassurance about the reproducibility of the result. These findings might support use of the 95% confidence interval lower bound even if only a single study of the active control drug in the population is available for the NI trial. b. Determining HESDE from multiple trials Identical clinical trials in identical populations can produce different estimates of treatment effect by chance alone. The extent to which two or more studies produce estimates of treatment effect that are close is a function of the sample size of each study, the similarity of the study populations, the conduct of the studies (e.g., dropout rates), and other factors that are probably not measurable. Therefore, another source of uncertainty to be considered when choosing a margin for the current NI study is the study-to-study variability in the estimate of the active control treatment effect. Multiple studies of the active control relative to a placebo, ineffective treatment, or no treatment provide an opportunity to obtain not only an estimate of the average effect of the active control and its uncertainty, but also a measure of the study-to-study variability of the effect. Study-to- study variability in the active control effect is a critical consideration because one of the basic assumptions in NI studies is the consistency of the effect between the historical studies and the current NI study. 23 Several cases illustrate the use of multiple studies to estimate the active control effect and problems that can arise. • The ideal case is one where (1) there are a number of studies, each of sufficient size to demonstrate the effect of the active control and (2) the effects derived from these studies are reasonably consistent, so that an average effect derived from a meta-analysis provides a reasonable estimate of the control effect and supports a credible choice of M1. • If there are many small studies, some of which have not demonstrated an effect of the active control, it may still be possible to estimate the active control effect combining the studies using appropriate meta-analysis methods, but care should be taken if there is evidence of a large amount of study-to-study heterogeneity in the treatment effects. • If there are multiple large studies, it would be troublesome if one or more of the studies showed little or no effect.

Unless there is a convincing explanation as to why one of the studies did not demonstrate an effect, a failed study may argue against use of an NI design. • There are sometimes several trials of different drugs in the same pharmacologic class. Pooling them with appropriate meta-analytic methods may allow calculation of a 95% confidence interval that is narrower than that from any single study. The presumption that the pharmacologically similar drugs would have similar effects may be reasonable, but care should be exercised in extending this assumption too far. If the effects of these different drugs vary considerably in the trials, it may be reasonable to use the combined data to estimate the average effect with a meta-analysis and then select the drug with the largest effect (point estimate) as the active control in the NI study. When multiple studies of the active control are available, it is important to consider all studies and all patients when estimating the average effect. Dropping a study that does not show an effect, unless there is a very good reason, can overestimate the control drug effect and give a falsely high M 1. As noted above, the existence of properly designed and sized studies that show no treatment effect of the active control may preclude conducting NI studies with that control unless there are valid reasons to explain the disparate results. When combining data from multiple studies to estimate the active control effect, some variation of effect is expected. Random-effects meta-analysis can be used that allow for both between- study and within-study heterogeneity. Both frequentist and Bayesian methods are available that differ in the assumptions made about the distribution of the random effects. These methods should be used to explore whether the variation between studies is more than would be expected by chance. If so, the between-study variation should be taken into account and will result in a more conservative margin for the NI study. Examples 1 and 2 in the Appendix illustrate in more detail how multiple historical placebo-controlled trials of the active control are evaluated in designing an NI trial. c. Metrics 24 As previously discussed, the assumption of constancy of the effect of the active comparator between the historical studies and the NI study is crucial to a conclusion of efficacy based on non-inferiority. There are, however, technical difficulties in defining what is meant by a constant effect across studies in different populations and at different times. The mathematical way in which the treatment effect is formulated will affect the meaning and plausibility of the constancy assumption. Consider, for example, studies of fairly infrequent, binary outcomes, typical of most cardiovascular studies, a situation in which NI trials have been successfully employed. Suppose the chance of an event in the placebo group of a historical study was p 1, and in the active treatment group p2. Then the treatment effect in the historical study can be expressed in several ways: 1. The ratio p2/p1, called the relative risk or risk ratio 2. The relative risk reduction 1 – p2/p1 3. The odds ratio [p2/(1 – p2)]/[p1/(1 – p1)] 4. The risk difference p1 – p2 5. The number needed to treat (NNT), 1/(p1 – p2) If p 1 and p2 vary across studies, they might nevertheless vary in such a way that p2/p1 is constant. For example, if p1 and p2 are 0.10 and 0.05 in one study, and 0.06 and 0.03 in another study, the ratio p2/p1 is 0.5 in both studies. The relative risk reduction will then also be the same in both studies, and the odds ratio will be approximately the same. The risk difference, however, is 0.05 in one study and 0.03 in the other, and the numbers needed to treat are 20 and 33. In contrast, if two studies have different p 1 and p2 but the same risk difference, they will have the same NNT but cannot have the same relative risk, relative risk reduction, or odds ratio. Thus, the very definition of constancy depends on how the effect is formulated mathematically. Because the interpretation of a NI study relies crucially on the assumption of constancy, careful consideration must be given to the question of what, if anything, is likely to be constant across historical studies and between the historical studies and the NI study.

Because the interpretation of a NI study relies crucially on the assumption of constancy, careful consideration must be given to the question of what, if anything, is likely to be constant across historical studies and between the historical studies and the NI study. As noted, based on both experience and expectation, the constancy assumption for outcome studies has generally been based on expected constancy of relative and not absolute effects. The difference between expressing the treatment effect as the absolute difference between success rates in treatment groups and as the relative risk or risk ratio for success on the test treatment relative to the active comparator is illustrated in the following two examples. For the first example, consider a disease where the cure rate is at least 40% in patients receiving the selected active control and 30% for those on placebo, a 10% difference in cure rates. If the purpose of an NI study is to demonstrate that the test product is effective (i.e., superior to a placebo), then the difference between the test product and active control in the NI study must be less than 10%. The margin M 1 would then be 10%. If the additional clinical objective is to establish that the test product preserves at least half of the active control’s effect, then the cure rate of the test product must be shown to be less than 5% lower than the control, the M2 margin. 25 This approach requires that the control drug have an effect of at least 10% relative to placebo (had there been one) in the NI study. If the population in the NI study did not have such a benefit (e.g., if the patients all had illnesses not susceptible to the test drug such that the benefit was less than 10%), then even if the 5% difference were ruled out, that would not demonstrate the desired effectiveness (although it would seem to). Note that in this case, if the true effect of the control in the study were 8%, then ruling out a 5% difference would in fact show some effect of the test drug, just not the desired 50% of control effect. The second example illustrates a NI margin selected for the risk ratio (test/control) metric. Let C and P represent the true rates of an undesirable outcome for the control and a placebo, respectively. The control’s effect compared to placebo is expressed by the risk ratio, C/P. A risk ratio of 1 represents no effect; a ratio of less than 1 shows an effect, a reduction in rate of undesirable outcomes. Metrics like the risk ratio may be less affected by variability in the event rates in a placebo group that would occur in a future study. For example, a risk ratio for the event of interest of 3/4 =0.75 can be derived from very different absolute failure rates from different studies, as shown in the table below. While the risk ratio is similar in all four hypothetical studies, the absolute difference in failure rates ranges from 5% to 20%. Suppose that the NI margin were based on historical studies showing control drug effects like those in the fourth study. The NI margin (M 1) would then be chosen as 20%. Now suppose that under more modern circumstances the NI study had a control rate more like Study 1 and the size of the treatment effect compared to placebo is far less than 20%. An NI margin (M1) of 20% would then be far greater than the drug effect in the NI study, and ruling out a difference of 20% would not demonstrate effectiveness at all. Thus, if the NI margin were chosen as ruling out an inferiority of 33% (or a relative risk of 1.33, i.e., 1 ÷ 0.75), and the control rate were 15%, the difference (M1) between test and control would need to be less than 5% (15% x 1.33 = 20%, or 5% > the 15% rate in the active control group). Study Number Risk Ratio (C/P) Control rate Placebo rate Study 1 ¾ 15% 20% Study 2 ¾ 30% 40% Study 3 ¾ 45% 60% Study 4 ¾ 60% 80% In this case, where absolute effect sizes vary but risk reductions are reasonably constant, the risk ratio metric provides a better adjustment to the lower event rate in the NI study. Revisiting the example from section III.E, it was clear in the placebo-controlled trials of streptokinase that the mortality rate in the placebo group was decreasing, so that even if the mortality reduction were constant as a relative reduction, the absolute reduction would decrease and the expected size of the treatment effect (M 1) would no longer be an absolute 2.1% reduction. The relative risk of mortality (ratio of mortality rates) was therefore used for subsequent thrombolytic product development programs because thrombolytic efficacy expressed as the relative mortality rates appeared to be more stable over time as improved standards of care were provided"}

The relative risk of mortality (ratio of mortality rates) was therefore used for subsequent thrombolytic product development programs because thrombolytic efficacy expressed as the relative mortality rates appeared to be more stable over time as improved standards of care were provided to all patients in a study. 26 For the development of tenecteplase in the treatment of AMI, evaluation of the relevant historical studies led to the conclusion that the comparator (90 minute infusion of alteplase) would reduce the relative risk of mortality compared to placebo by at least 0.22 (to about 0.78, upper limit of the relative risk confidence interval). The NI margin was chosen, again based upon clinical judgment, so the new drug would retain at least half of the efficacy of the comparator (M 1 = 0.22), i.e., at least 0.11 (M2). The relative mortality risk of tenecteplase compared to placebo should be not greater than 0.89. This provided a value for the limit of the relative risk comparison of tenecteplase to alteplase of 1.14 ([tenecteplase/placebo]/[alteplase/placebo] = 0.89/0.78), which had to be excluded by the 95% confidence interval (one-sided in this case) of the ratio of mortality rates in the NI study. The ASSENT II study results provided a 95% one- sided upper limit of relative risk of 1.104, which led to the marketing approval of tenecteplase. These examples illustrate the importance of understanding how a particular metric will perform. The choice between a relative metric (e.g., risk ratio) and an absolute metric (e.g., a difference in rates) in characterizing the effects of treatments may also be based upon clinical interpretation, medical context, and previous experience with the behavior of the rates of the outcome. d. Discounting One strategy employed in choosing the margin M 1 for the NI study design is “discounting” or reducing the magnitude of the active control’s effect that is estimated from the HESDE analysis. Such discounting is done to account for the uncertainties in the assumptions that need to be made in estimating, based on past performance, the effect of the active control in the NI study. This concept of discounting focuses on M 1 determination and is distinct from a clinical judgment that the effect that can be lost on clinical grounds should be some fraction of M1 (i.e., M2). As discussed above, there are uncertainties associated with translating the historical effect of the active control (HESDE) to the new situation of the active control NI trial, and it is tempting to deal with that uncertainty in the constancy assumption by discounting the effect (e.g., “take half”). Rather than applying “automatic” discounting in choosing M 1, concerns about the active control effect should, to the extent possible: • Be specific • Make use of available data (e.g., magnitude of possible differences in effect in different patient populations, consistency of past studies, and consistency within studies across population subsets) • Take into account factors that reduce the need for a conservative estimate, such as the pharmacologic similarity of the test and control drugs and pharmacodynamic effects of the new drug A closely related issue is the possible need for adjustment of M 1 to reflect any differences that were observed between the population in the NI study and the historical study. For example, a finding of a smaller effect in women than in men in the historical studies would need to be considered in assessing the validity of M1 if the NI study had a substantially greater proportion of women than the historical studies. In general, the assessment of the historical data should identify differences in the outcomes for important subgroups so that the statistical analysis plan 27 for the NI study can be designed prospectively to take these factors into account (e.g., through covariate adjustments) or so that the value of M1 can be revisited in light of the baseline characteristics of the study population that was enrolled in the NI study. C. Fixed Margin and Synthesis Methods Conceptually, the conclusion of non-inferiority is a synthesis of information from the NI trial itself and the historical evidence that the comparator in that trial was effective. The historical trials assessed C h – P, the effect of the active control compared to placebo. The NI trial assesses T – Cn , the effect of the test drug compared to active control. If the outcome for the active control is constant across studies, then Cn = Ch, and the sum T – Cn + Ch – P = T – P represents the effect of the test drug compared to placebo. The indispensable purpose of a NI trial is to show with high confidence that this effect is positive. Additionally, NI trials are usually intended to estimate this effect, at least roughly, in comparison"}

Additionally, NI trials are usually intended to estimate this effect, at least roughly, in comparison to the historical effect of the active control. The historical studies will furnish an estimate of C h – P with an associated standard error SEH. Similarly, the NI study will estimate T – Cn with a standard error SEN. The two estimates are independent, so that the standard error of the sum is given by �𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐻𝐻 2 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 2 . Notwithstanding that the interpretation of an NI study is fundamentally a synthesis, we recommend a statistical method, the fixed-margin method, that treats the problem in two separate steps. This approach offers two practical advantages. First, it allows separation of the problem of calculating, justifying, and possibly adjusting the NI margins M1 and M2 from the problem of analyzing the NI study. Second, it is equivalent to applying a somewhat larger standard error to the synthesized estimate, which can be seen as an allowance for the possibility of minor deviations from constancy. 1. The Fixed Margin Approach The fixed margin approach to analysis in an NI trial is well known (see, e.g., ICH E9, section 3.3.2). This approach relies upon the choice of a fixed NI margin that is prespecified at the design stage of the NI trial and used to determine the sample size needed to provide sufficient power for a test of the hypothesis of non-inferiority. Operationally, the fixed margin approach usually proceeds in the following manner. First, the active control effect is estimated from an analysis of past placebo-controlled studies of the active control (see section IV.B.2.a-b). The goal of this analysis is to define the margin M 1, a fixed value based on the past effect of the active control that is intended to be no larger than the effect the active control is expected to have in the NI study. The variability of the treatment effects observed across past studies as well as the constancy assumption should be taken into account in choosing M 1. 28 The selection of M2 is then based on clinical judgment regarding how much of the active comparator treatment effect needs to be retained to demonstrate sufficient benefit for drug approval. The exercise of clinical judgment for the determination of M2 should be applied after the determination of M1 has been made. All relevant studies of the active comparator and all randomized patients within these studies should generally be used in determining the margin M1 because that provides a more reliable estimate of the active control effect and avoids any potential for prejudice in selecting which historical studies to include. Determination of the relevance of past studies, however, may not be straightforward, and Examples 1(A) and 2 in the Appendix illustrate this point. The lower bound of the confidence interval of the estimated active control effect based on past studies is typically selected as M 1. Concerns about past variability and constancy may lead to a determination to discount this lower bound in choosing M1 to account for any sources of uncertainty and dissimilarities between the historical data and the NI study to be conducted, as discussed in earlier sections. Following this, a clinical judgment is made as to how much of this effect should be preserved. Choosing M 2 as 50% of M1 has become usual practice for cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies, where effects may be small, and it is important to retain at least half of the effect of the original treatment. In antibiotic trials, effects tend to be quite large relative to placebo or ineffective treatments, and as a result, a 10-15% NI margin for the treatment difference (M 2) is commonly chosen. Note that the M2 of 50% of M1 is on a relative scale, whereas the 10-15% is on the risk difference scale for antibiotic drugs. The formal test of the NI hypothesis also involves the use of a 95% confidence interval (i.e., to rule out C-T > M 2). Thus, there are two confidence intervals involved in the fixed margin approach, one for the historical data, where the lower bound is selected as M1, and one for the NI study (to rule out C-T > M2); both intervals are typically 95% confidence intervals. That is why this fixed margin approach is sometimes called the 95%-95% method. Separating the process of estimating the treatment effect of the active comparator based upon the historical data (i.e., choice of M 1) from the analysis of the NI study has two advantages. It gives a single number that is clinically understandable for M1 (and derived M2) and"}

It gives a single number that is clinically understandable for M1 (and derived M2) and provides a basis for planning the sample size of the NI study to achieve control of Type I error and the power needed for the NI study to meet its objective for the prespecified NI margin. Decisions to discount M1 further or, where appropriate, to use a narrower confidence interval, are easily explained, and will make the fixed margin approach either more or less conservative. Deciding on the NI clinical margin M 2 is a matter of judgment about how large a loss of the control treatment effect would be acceptable, a consideration that may reflect the seriousness of the outcome, the benefit of the active comparator, and the relative safety profiles of the test and comparator. Choice of M2 also has major practical implications. For example, in large cardiovascular studies, it is unusual to have an M2 that reflects a loss of less than 50% of the control drug effect, even if this might be clinically reasonable, because doing so will usually make the study size infeasible. Of course, allowing too much inferiority of the test drug to the standard, especially for endpoints of mortality and serious morbidity, would clearly not be acceptable. 29 The fixed margin approach considers the NI margin as a single number, fixed in advance of the NI study. The hypothesis tested in the NI study determines whether the comparison of the test drug to the active control meets the specified NI criterion, assuming, of course, that the active control had at least its expected effect (equal to M1) (that is, the study had assay sensitivity). A successful NI conclusion, ruling out a difference > M1, shows that the test drug is effective (just as a superiority study showing a significant effect at p ≤ 0.05 does) and, if a difference > M2 is also ruled out, shows that the new drug preserves the desired fraction of the control drug’s effect. 2. The Synthesis Approach An alternative statistical approach is known as the synthesis approach because it combines or synthesizes the data from the historical trials and the current NI trial, reflecting the variability in the two sources of data (the current NI study and the past studies used to determine HESDE). The synthesis method is designed to directly address the question of whether the test product would have been superior to a placebo had a placebo been in the NI study and also to address the related question of what fraction of the active control’s effect is maintained by the test product. In the synthesis approach, M 1 is not prespecified, but the percent of active control effect to be preserved is prespecified. Based on the observed outcome of the test drug vs. active control comparison in the NI study, an evaluation is made as to whether the test agent has demonstrated preservation of the clinically relevant effect of the active control, without determining M 1. Although the synthesis approach combines the data from the historical trials into the comparison of the concurrent active control and the test drug in the NI study, a direct randomized concurrent comparison with a placebo is of course not possible, because the placebo group is not a concurrent control and there is no randomization to such a group within the NI study. The imputed comparison with a placebo group that is not part of the NI study thus rests on the validity of several assumptions, just as the fixed margin approach does. The critical assumption of the constancy of the active control effect derived from the historical placebo-controlled trials is just as important when the synthesis method is used as when the fixed margin method is used. The use of the synthesis approach can lead to a more efficiently designed study (e.g., by allowing for a reduction in sample size or achieving greater power for a given sample size) than the fixed margin approach, provided the constancy assumption holds. The greater statistical efficiency of the synthesis approach derives from how this method deals with the standard error of the comparison of test product to active control. See Appendix, Example 1(B), for a comparison of the two methods and the variance calculations. The synthesis approach does not specify a fixed NI margin. Rather, the method combines (or synthesizes) the estimate of the treatment effect relative to the control from the NI trial with the estimate of the control effect from a meta-analysis of historical trials.

Rather, the method combines (or synthesizes) the estimate of the treatment effect relative to the control from the NI trial with the estimate of the control effect from a meta-analysis of historical trials. The synthesis process makes use of the variability from the NI trial and the historical trials and yields one confidence interval for testing the NI hypothesis that the treatment preserves a fixed fraction of the control effect, without actually specifying that control effect or a specific fixed NI margin based on the control effect. Clinical judgment is used to prespecify an acceptable fraction of the control therapy’s effect that should be retained by the test drug, regardless of the magnitude of the 30 control effect. The disadvantage of the synthesis approach is that it is not possible to use clinical judgment to choose M2, based on the magnitude of M1, in advance of the NI trial. D. Considerations for Selecting the Clinical Margin (M2) M 2 is the prespecified NI margin that is to be ruled out in an NI study. The determination of M2 is based on clinical judgment and is usually calculated by taking a percentage or fraction of M1. The clinical judgment in determining M2 may take into account the actual disease incidence or prevalence and its impact on the practicality of sample sizes that would have to be accrued for a study, as noted above with respect to cardiovascular outcome studies. There can be flexibility in selecting the M 2 margin, choosing a wider margin, for example, when: 1. The primary endpoint does not involve an irreversible outcome such as death (in general, the M2 margin will be more stringent when treatment failure results in an irreversible outcome) 2. The test product is associated with fewer serious adverse effects or better tolerability than other therapies already available 3. The test product has another advantage over available therapies that warrants use of a less stringent margin (M 2) A more stringent choice for M2 may be required, however, when the difference between the active comparator response rate and the untreated response rate is large, making it feasible to demonstrate retention of a larger fraction of M1 without requiring an impractical sample size for the NI study. The implication of failing to rule out inferiority relative to M 1 and M2 differs. Failure to exclude inferiority relative to M1 means there is no assurance of any effect. Just as it would be unusual to accept a placebo-controlled study as positive (i.e., a finding of superiority) with p > 0.05, it would be unusual to accept an NI study as positive (i.e., a finding of non-inferiority) where the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was > M1. On the other hand, failing to exclude M2 by a small amount (e.g., ruling out a loss of 52% of M1 rather than a prespecified loss of 50% of M1) may be acceptable, as the small amount would not suggest the absence of an effect of the drug. E. Estimating the Sample Size It is important to plan the sample size for an NI clinical trial so that the trial will have adequate statistical power to conclude that the NI margin is ruled out if the test drug is truly non-inferior. At the protocol planning stage, using the fixed margin approach, the NI margin (M 2) will be specified, and the sample size will be based on the need to rule out that margin. Both the size of the margin and the estimated variance of the treatment effect (T vs C) will affect the sample size determination. For event-driven trials, if the event rate in the NI study is lower than anticipated, power to demonstrate non-inferiority will be reduced. It may be important, therefore, to monitor overall (blinded) event rates during the study and to adjust the sample size if the interim event rates are unexpectedly low, a practice that is common in superiority trials. There is one further consideration in sample size planning. If, in reality, the test drug is somewhat more effective 31 than the control, it will be easier to rule out any given NI margin than if the test drug is equivalent or slightly inferior to the control, and a smaller sample size could be used. A somewhat less effective test drug will, of course, require a larger sample size. It may be difficult to adequately plan the sample size for any study, including an NI study, because of uncertainty about assumptions such as event rates or endpoint variability at the time of study planning. For this reason, adaptive study designs that can allow for the prospective re- estimation of a larger sample size at one or more planned interim looks may be considered. F. Study Quality and Choice of Analysis"}

For this reason, adaptive study designs that can allow for the prospective re- estimation of a larger sample size at one or more planned interim looks may be considered. F. Study Quality and Choice of Analysis Population Traditionally, the primary analysis of a randomized clinical superiority trial follows the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, namely, all randomized patients are analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized, including patients who leave the study prematurely. This approach is intended to avoid various biases associated with patients switching treatment or patients being excluded from the analysis because of protocol violations or attrition. Adhering to the ITT principle in superiority trials is generally considered conservative, in that poor study quality resulting in a large number of protocol violations will tend to bias the results towards the null hypothesis of no difference between treatments. The opposite is true for NI trials. Quality issues could result in treatment groups appearing similar (i.e., biasing the results towards the alternative hypothesis for NI trials), when, in fact, the test drug may be inferior, as mentioned in section III.D.3. Many problems that may cause a superiority trial to fail, such as non-adherence, misclassification of the primary endpoint, or attrition, can bias the results toward no treatment difference (success) and undermine the validity of the trial, creating apparent non-inferiority when the test drug is in fact inferior. Imputation of missing data under the inferiority null hypothesis is one possible approach to countering the bias due to attrition. The best advice for conducting an NI study is to emphasize study quality at the planning stage and continuously monitor the trial during the conduct and analysis stages to minimize the problems described above. If the NI trial is open label, attention to quality is all the more important because it may be very difficult to prove, after the fact, that enrollment, assessment of endpoints, and other study procedures were conducted in an unbiased way. G. Testing Non-Inferiority and Superiority in a Single Trial In general, when there is only one primary endpoint and one dose of the test treatment, a trial that is planned to demonstrate non-inferiority may also be used to test for superiority without concern about inflating the Type I error rate. This sequential testing procedure has the Type I error rates for tests of both non-inferiority and superiority controlled at the 2.5% level. A study designed primarily to show superiority, however, would yield credible evidence of non-inferiority only if the study had the key features of a NI study (e.g., the NI margin must be prespecified, and assay sensitivity and HESDE must be established). An unplanned determination of non-inferiority following failure to show superiority, when the margin was not determined until results of the trial were known, would not be sufficient for demonstrating non-inferiority of the test drug. 32 When multiple endpoints or multiple doses of the test treatment are to be evaluated in an NI study that also includes a test for superiority, careful planning of the order in which hypothesis tests are to be carried out is needed. For example, will superiority of the primary endpoint be tested before or after non-inferiority of a key secondary endpoint? A decision tree can be helpful in determining whether adjustments for multiplicity are needed and to what tests they should be applied to ensure that adequate control of the Type I error rate is achieved for the trial. In general, it would not be appropriate to apply 95% confidence intervals for multiple tests of non- inferiority and superiority across multiple endpoints or multiple doses because of the potential to inflate the Type I error rate for the trial; use of larger intervals that reflect adjustment for multiple tests (e.g., 97.5% confidence intervals or higher) may be needed. V. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND GENERAL GUIDANCE 1. Can a margin be defined when there are no historical placebo-controlled trials of the active control for the disease being assessed in the NI study? If the active control has shown superiority to other active treatments in the past, the difference demonstrated represents a conservative estimate of HESDE, one that can certainly serve as a basis for choosing M 1. It may also be possible that trials of the active control in related diseases are relevant. The more difficult question is whether historical experience from nonconcurrently controlled trials can be used to define the NI margin.

If the active control has shown superiority to other active treatments in the past, the difference demonstrated represents a conservative estimate of HESDE, one that can certainly serve as a basis for choosing M 1. It may also be possible that trials of the active control in related diseases are relevant. The more difficult question is whether historical experience from nonconcurrently controlled trials can be used to define the NI margin. The answer is that it can, but only in situations that meet the following three general criteria for assessing the persuasiveness of a historically controlled trial (see ICH E10). • First, there should be a good estimate of the historical untreated response rate or outcome without treatment. Examination of medical literature and other sources of information may provide data upon which to base these estimates (e.g., historical information on natural history or the results of ineffective therapy). • Second, the cure rate of the active control should be estimated from historical experience, preferably from multiple experiences in various settings and possibly including observational studies. • Third, the untreated and treated patients should be comparable. Then, if the treated and untreated response rates are substantially different, it may be possible to determine a NI margin. For example, if the spontaneous cure rate of a disease is 10-20% and the cure rate with an active control is 70-80%, these rates are substantially different and can be used to determine M 1. The clinically acceptable loss of this effect can then be determined for M2. Some examples of margins determined in this way have been presented in guidance on antibiotic trials, e.g., trials in community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (see Example 4 in the Appendix). Identifying a margin is more difficult when the difference between the spontaneous cure rate and active drug cure rate is smaller. For example, if the historical spontaneous cure rate is 40% and the active control rate is 55%, identifying the NI margin in this case as 15% would not be reasonable because such a small difference could easily be the result of a different disease definition or ancillary therapy. When the historical cure rates for the active control and the cure rate in patients who receive no treatment are not known at all from actual studies (i.e., are just based on clinical impressions), it will be difficult or impossible to define an NI margin. 33 2. Can the margin M2 be flexible? As discussed in detail in sections III and IV, there is a critical difference between demonstrating that the margins M 1 and M2 have been met. M1 is used to determine whether the NI study shows that the test drug has any effect at all. Accepting a result in which the 95% confidence interval did not rule out a loss of M1 or greater would be similar to accepting as evidence of effectiveness a superiority study whose estimated treatment effect was not significant at p ≤ 0.05. M2, in contrast, represents clinical judgment about the amount of the active control effect that must be retained. A typical value for M2 is often 50% of M1, at least partly because the sample sizes needed to retain a larger amount, e.g., 60% or more, of the active control effect become impractically large. In this case, there is a better argument for some degree of flexibility if the study did not quite rule out the M2 margin; there might be reason to consider, for example, assurance of 48% retention as acceptable. We have also concluded that the more conservative fixed margin method should generally be used in ensuring that M1 is ruled out, but that the synthesis method can be used to assess non- inferiority with respect to M2. Of course, allowing the test drug to be inferior to the standard by too large an amount, especially for endpoints of mortality and serious morbidity, would not be acceptable. 3. Can prior information or other data (e.g., studies of related drugs, pharmacologic effects) be considered statistically in choosing the NI margins or in deciding whether the NI study has demonstrated its objective? Prior information can be incorporated into a statistical model or within a Bayesian framework to take into account such factors as evidence of effects in other related indications or on other endpoints. As discussed in section IV.B.2.b, a meta-analysis is often used to estimate the average effect of the active control for purposes of setting the NI margin, and in certain circumstances, trials from related indications or for other drugs in the same class may be included in the meta-analysis conducted for this purpose. Some methods of meta-analysis allow the down-weighting of less relevant studies or studies that are not randomized or controlled (e.g., observational studies), which can be particularly important if few placebo- controlled trials are available. Bayesian methods that incorporate historical information from past active control studies through the use of prior distributions of model parameters provide an alternative approach to evaluating non-inferiority in the NI trial itself. Although discussed in the literature and used in other research settings, CDER and CBER have not had much experience to date in evaluating NI trials of new drugs or therapeutic biologics that make use of a Bayesian approach for design and analysis.

Although discussed in the literature and used in other research settings, CDER and CBER have not had much experience to date in evaluating NI trials of new drugs or therapeutic biologics that make use of a Bayesian approach for design and analysis. If a sponsor is planning to conduct a Bayesian NI trial, early discussions with the Agency are advised. If important covariates are distributed differently in the historical studies than in the current NI study, model-based approaches may be used to adjust for these covariates in the NI analysis. Such covariates should be identified prior to the NI trial, and the methods for covariate adjustment should be specified prospectively in the NI trial protocol. Applying 34 post-hoc adjustments developed at the time of analyzing the NI trial would not be appropriate. 4. Can a drug product be used as the active comparator in a study designed to show non- inferiority if the product’s labeling does not have the indication for the disease being studied, and could published reports in the literature be used to support a treatment effect of the active control? The active control does not have to be labeled or approved in the United States for the indication being studied in the NI study as long as there are adequate data that are reliable and reproducible to support the chosen NI margin. FDA does, in some cases, rely on published literature and has done so in carrying out the meta-analyses of the effect of the active control that are used to define NI margins. The FDA guidance, “Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness,” describes the approach to considering the use of literature in providing evidence of effectiveness, and similar considerations would apply here. Among these considerations are: • The quality of the publications (the level of detail provided) • The difficulty of assessing the endpoints used • Changes in practice between the present and the time of the studies • Whether FDA has reviewed some or all of the studies • Whether FDA and the sponsor have access to the original data As noted above, the endpoint for the NI study could be different (e.g., death, heart attack, and stroke) from the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death) in the studies if the alternative endpoint is well assessed and data on that endpoint are available for determining M 1 (see also question 6). 5. If the active control drug is approved for the indication that is being studied, does the margin need to be justified, or if the active control drug has been used as an active comparator in the past in another study of design similar to the current study and a margin has been justified previously, can one simply refer to the previous margin used? When an active control drug is approved for the same indication as that of the NI trial, the size of the effect appearing in the label of the active control is usually based on the pivotal trials rather than a meta-analysis of all past studies. Further, the variability of the effect across past studies may not be available. In general, approval of a drug is based on showing superiority to placebo, usually in at least two studies, but FDA may not have critically assessed whether the effect is consistent across past studies and may not have analyzed any “failed” studies. It is therefore essential to use the data from all available controlled trials (unless a trial has a significant defect), including trials conducted after marketing, to calculate a reasonable estimate of the actual control effect. If the active control data have been used to define the NI margin for another study of the same indication, and if a determination is made that the trials involved are relevant to the new trial, then use of the same margin in the new trial should be acceptable. 35 6. What factors should be considered when selecting an endpoint for a NI trial? The endpoints chosen for clinical trials (superiority or non-inferiority) should be clinically meaningful measures of the way patients feel, function, or survive that can be reliably assessed in the target population. The endpoints generally reflect the event rate or other measure of disease in the population but also must take into account practical considerations, such as the size of the study required to demonstrate superiority or non-inferiority with respect to the endpoint. In NI studies, the endpoint must be one for which there is a good basis for knowing the effect of the active control. The endpoint need not necessarily be the endpoint used in the historical trials or the effectiveness endpoint appearing in labeling of the active control. Past trials that were successful in showing an effect on a mortality endpoint could, for example, serve as the"}

In NI studies, the endpoint must be one for which there is a good basis for knowing the effect of the active control. The endpoint need not necessarily be the endpoint used in the historical trials or the effectiveness endpoint appearing in labeling of the active control. Past trials that were successful in showing an effect on a mortality endpoint could, for example, serve as the basis for estimating an effect on a composite endpoint (cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke), if that were the desired endpoint for the NI study. The use of a different endpoint in the NI study might be desirable because it would permit a smaller study, but it would be important not to include components that were not affected by the active control or did not represent an important clinical benefit. 7. Are there circumstances where conducting an NI study may not be feasible? Unfortunately, these are several, including some where a placebo-controlled study would not be considered ethical. Some examples include the following: • The treatment effect of the active comparator may be so small that the sample size required to conduct a NI study may not be feasible (unless the test drug is assumed to be superior). • There is large study-to-study variability in the treatment effect. In this case, the treatment effect may not be sufficiently reproducible, calling into question the assumption of assay sensitivity. This is often the case for symptomatic treatments (e.g., treatments for depression, anxiety, insomnia, angina, symptomatic heart failure, symptoms of irritable bowel disease, and pain). • There is no historical evidence available to determine a NI margin, and assuming a zero response rate for untreated patients is not reasonable. • Medical practice has changed so much (e.g., the active control is always used with additional drugs) that the effect of the active control in the historical studies is not relevant to the current study. 8. In a situation where a placebo-controlled trial would be considered unethical, but a NI study cannot be performed, what are the options? In that case it may be possible to design a superiority study in an appropriate population that would be considered ethical. Several possibilities are discussed in ICH E10 and include the following: 36 • When the new drug and an established treatment are pharmacologically distinct, an add- on study where the test drug and placebo are each added to the established treatment. • A study in patients who do not respond to the established therapy. It may be possible to conduct a placebo-controlled trial in these patients. Alternatively, nonresponders could be randomly assigned to the test drug or the failed therapy, and superiority assessed to demonstrate effectiveness in the nonresponder population. • A study in patients who cannot tolerate the established effective therapy. • A study of a population for which there is no available effective therapy. • A dose-response study without placebo, if the new drug is known to have dose-related side effects, and a dose lower than the usual dose would be considered ethical. 9. When can a single NI study be sufficient to support effectiveness? Several sections above touch on this question, notably section III.H, which discusses this issue in detail. Briefly, reliance on a single study in the NI setting is based on considerations similar to reliance on a single study in the superiority setting, with the additional consideration of the stringency of showing non-inferiority using the M 2 margin. Many of these considerations are described in the FDA guidance, “Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness”, and include supportive information, such as results with pharmacologically similar agents (a very common consideration, because the NI study will often compare drugs of the same pharmacologic class), support from credible biomarker information (tumor responses, ACE inhibition, beta blockade), and a statistically persuasive result from the single NI study. With respect to the latter, it is noted above that a finding of NI based on excluding a treatment difference > M 2 provides very strong evidence that the test treatment has an effect > 0 when M2 is substantially smaller than M1. For all these reasons, most NI studies with mortality or serious morbidity as endpoints, if clearly successful, will be sufficient to demonstrate NI as single studies. 37 APPENDIX — EXAMPLES The following four examples derived from publicly available information (see references following examples) illustrate determination of the NI margin, application of methods of NI analysis, and other considerations relevant to determining whether it is possible to conduct and interpret the results of an NI study.

Warfarin is a highly effective, orally active anticoagulant that is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation at risk of thromboembolic complications (e.g., stroke, TIA). There are six placebo-controlled studies of warfarin involving the treatment of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, all published between the years 1989 and 1993. The primary results of these studies are summarized in Table 1 and provide the basis for choosing the NI margin for SPORTIF V. The point estimate of the event rate (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes plus systemic embolic events) on warfarin compared to placebo is favorable to warfarin in each of the six studies. The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of the risk ratio calculated in each study is less than one in five of the six studies, indicating a significant treatment effect in favor of warfarin. The one exception is the CAFA study. However, this study was reportedly stopped early because of favorable results published from the AFASAK and SPAF I studies (Connolly et al. 1991). Although the CAFA study was stopped early, a step that can sometimes lead to an overestimate of effect, the data from this study appear relevant in characterizing the overall evidence of effectiveness of warfarin because there is no reason to think it was stopped for early success, which might have introduced a favorable bias. These placebo-controlled studies of warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation show a fairly consistent effect. Based on the positive results from five of the six studies, it can reasonably be assumed that were placebo to be included in a warfarin-controlled NI study involving a novel anticoagulant, warfarin would have been superior to placebo.

As can be seen from the summary table, most of these studies were open label. It is not clear how great a concern this should be given the reasonably objective endpoints in the study (see Table 2), but to the extent there was judgment involved in assessing the endpoints, there may have been the potential for bias to be introduced. The event rate for placebo in the EAFT study was strikingly high, perhaps because the patient population in that study was different from the patient population in the remaining five studies, in that only patients with a recent TIA or stroke were enrolled in EAFT. That factor would clearly increase the event rate, but in fact the risk reduction in EAFT was very similar to the four trials other than CAFA, which is relatively reassuring with respect to constancy of risk reduction in various AF populations. Even if the historical studies are consistent, a critical consideration in deciding upon the NI margin is whether the constancy assumption is reasonable. That is, we must consider whether the magnitude of the effect of warfarin relative to placebo in the previous studies would be present in the new NI study, or whether changes in medical practice (e.g., concomitant medications, skill at reaching the desired International Normalised Ratio (INR)), or changes in the population being studied may make the effect of warfarin estimated from the previous studies not relevant to the current NI study.

There is considerable heterogeneity in the demographic characteristics of these studies. While some characteristics can be compared across the studies (e.g., age, race, and target INR), some cannot (e.g., concomitant medication use, race, mean blood pressure at baseline) if they are not consistently reported in the study publications. Whether these are critical to outcomes is the question. Table 2 shows that for some characteristics, such as a history of stroke or TIA, there are some differences across the studies. An important inclusion criterion in the EAFT study was that subjects have a prior history of stroke or TIA. None of the other studies had such a requirement. Subjects enrolled into the EAFT study were thus at higher risk than subjects in the other studies, presumably leading to the higher event rates in both the warfarin and placebo arms, shown in Table 1. The higher event rates in the EAFT study may also have been influenced by the relatively long duration of follow-up or the fact that the primary endpoint definition was broader (including vascular deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions), or both. Even with the 39 higher event rates observed in this one study, however, the risk ratios are quite consistent (with the exception of CAFA), a relatively reassuring outcome. Table 2.

NA = Not available To calculate M1, the relative risks in each of the six studies were combined using a random effects meta-analysis to give a point estimate of 0.361 for the relative risk with a confidence interval of (0.248, 0.527). The 95% confidence interval upper bound of 0.527 represents a 47% risk reduction, which translates into a risk increase of about 90% from not being on warfarin (1/0.527 = 1.898) (i.e., what would be seen if the test drug had no effect). Thus, M 1 (in terms of the hazard ratio favoring the control to be ruled out) is 1.898. It was considered clinically important to show that the test drug preserved a substantial fraction of the warfarin effect. The clinical margin M 2 representing the largest acceptable level of inferiority was therefore set at 50% of M1. M2 was calculated on the log hazard scale as 1.378, so that NI would be demonstrated provided the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval for C vs. T < 1.378. In the SPORTIF V study, the point estimate of the relative risk was 1.39, and the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the relative risk was (0.91, 2.12). Thus, in this example, the non- inferiority of ximelegatran to warfarin is not demonstrated because the upper limit (2.12) is greater than M 2 (=1.378). Indeed, it does not even demonstrate that M1 (=1.898) has been excluded. 40 Example 1(B): Application of the Synthesis Method to Example 1(A) This example demonstrates the following: • The critical features of the synthesis method for demonstrating non-inferiority of a new anticoagulant • The calculations and sources of statistical variability that are incorporated in the synthesis approach • The main differences in interpretation of results from the fixed margin and the synthesis approaches when applied to the same set of studies and data In this example, we illustrate the synthesis method using the same data as Example 1(A), which consist of six studies comparing warfarin to placebo and one NI study comparing ximelegatran to warfarin.

In contrast to the fixed margin method in Example 1(A), the synthesis method does not use a separate 95% confidence interval for this historical estimate of the effect of warfarin versus placebo and for the comparison in the NI study. Rather, the synthesis method is constructed to address the questions of whether ximelegatran preserves a specified percent, in this case 50% of the effect of warfarin, and whether ximelegatran would be superior to a placebo, if placebo had been included as a randomized treatment group in the NI study. To accomplish this goal, the synthesis method makes a comparison of the effect of ximelegatran in the NI study to historical placebo data, an indirect comparison that is not based upon a randomized concurrent placebo group. The synthesis method combines the data from the placebo-controlled studies of warfarin with the data from the NI study in such a way that a test of hypothesis is made to demonstrate that a certain percent of the effect of warfarin is retained in the NI study. A critical point distinguishing the synthesis method from the fixed margin method is that the effect (M 1) of warfarin is not specified in advance. But to carry out the analysis, an assumption needs to be made regarding the placebo comparison, namely, that the difference between control drug and placebo (had there been one) in the NI trial is the same as that seen in the historical placebo-controlled trials of warfarin. The assumption is needed because there is no randomized comparison of warfarin and placebo in the NI trial. As a point of reference, we know from example 1(A) that the warfarin effect M 1 was estimated from the historical placebo-controlled studies to be a 47% risk reduction. In this case, the synthesis method statistically tests the null hypothesis that the inferiority of ximelegatran compared to warfarin is less than 50% or one half of the risk reduction of warfarin compared to placebo, a question that the fixed margin method does not directly address because in the fixed margin method, the placebo is only present in the historical studies and not in the NI study. We carry out this test on the log relative risk scale, so that the null hypothesis can be written as: 41 H0: {log-relative risk of ximelegatran versus warfarin} ≥ − ½ {log-relative risk of warfarin versus placebo} A test of this hypothesis is performed by the expression below (the statistical test) that has the form of a quotient where the numerator is an estimate of the parameter defined in the null hypothesis by {log-relative risk of ximelegatran versus warfarin} + ½ {log-relative risk of warfarin versus placebo} and the denominator is an estimate of the standard error of the numerator. In this case, the estimated log-relative risk of ximelegatran versus warfarin is 0.329 (log of 1.39) with a standard error of 0.216 while the estimated log-relative risk of warfarin versus placebo is − 1.02 (log of .361) with a standard error of 0.154. These estimates are combined, and the synthesis test statistic is calculated as: ( ) ( )[ ] 789 . 0 154 . 021216 . 0 02 . 121329 . 0 22 − = + − + Assuming the statistic is normally distributed, it is then compared to − 1.96 (for a one-sided Type I error rate of 0.025). For this case, the value, − 0.789, is not less (more negative) than − 1.96, so we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that an NI margin of 50% retention is satisfied using the synthesis method.

The effect of aspirin on mortality as measured by the relative risk appears to diminish over the years in which the studies were conducted. 2. The largest trial, AMIS, showed a numerically higher mortality rate in the aspirin- treated group. The relative risk in the AMIS study is significantly different from the mean relative risk in the remaining studies (p ≤ 0.005). The validity of pooling the results of AMIS with those of the remaining studies is therefore a concern. It would be invalid to exclude AMIS from the meta- analyses because the effect in AMIS differed from the effect in the remaining studies unless there were adequate clinical or scientific reasons for such exclusion. At a minimum, any meta- analysis of all studies would need to reflect this heterogeneity by using a random effects meta- analysis. Although a fixed effects meta-analysis of the six studies gives a point estimate of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.02), the random-effects analysis gives a point estimate of 0.86 with 95% confidence interval (0.69, 1.08). The effect of aspirin on prevention of death after myocardial infarction in these historical studies is thus inconclusive (i.e., the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for effect is > 1.0). Therefore, it is not possible to select aspirin as the active control for evaluating the mortality effect of a test drug in an NI trial. Even if the upper 43 bound excluded 1.0, it would be difficult to rely on an NI margin that is not supported by AMIS, the largest of the six trials. The same six studies can also be examined for the combined endpoint of death plus AMI in patients with recent AMI. This endpoint reflects the current physician-directed claim for aspirin based on the positive finding in two studies (MRC-2, PARIS). Table 4.

The results indicate that the effect of aspirin on death or MI after myocardial infarction is small to absent in the latest trial (AMIS). Random effects meta-analyses give point estimates of the relative risk of approximately 0.8 with 95% confidence interval upper bounds of approximately 1.0. The NI margin based on these six studies is close to zero (without reducing it further to represent M 2) and is so small that an NI trial would be unrealistically large. Again, as with the mortality endpoint, it would be troubling even to consider an NI approach when the largest and most recent trial showed no significant effect. 44 Example 3: Xeloda to Treat Metastatic Colorectal Cancer — the Synthesis Method This example of Xeloda for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer illustrates: • The use of the synthesis method to demonstrate a loss of no more than 50% of the historical control treatment’s effect and a relaxation of this criterion when two NI studies are available • The use of additional endpoints in the decision-making process • The use of a conservative estimate of the active control effect because (1) a subset of the available studies to estimate the margin was selected and (2) the effect was measured relative to a previous standard of care instead of placebo The U.S. regulatory standard for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, the use sought for Xeloda, is the demonstration of improvement in overall survival. Two separate clinical trials, each using an NI study design, compared Xeloda to a Mayo Clinic regimen of 5- fluorouracil with leucovorin (5-FU+LV), the standard of care at the time. Xeloda is an oral fluoropyrimidine, while 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is an infusional fluoropyrimidine. By itself, bolus 5-FU had not demonstrated a survival advantage"}

By itself, bolus 5-FU had not demonstrated a survival advantage in first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. But with the addition of leucovorin to bolus 5-FU, the combination had demonstrated improved survival. A systematic evaluation of approximately 30 studies that investigated the effect of adding leucovorin to a regimen of 5-FU identified 10 clinical trials that compared a regimen of 5-FU+LV similar to the Mayo Clinic regimen to 5-FU alone, thereby providing a measure of the effect of LV added to 5-FU — a conservative estimate of the overall effect of 5-FU+LV as it is likely 5-FU has some effect. Table 5 summarizes the overall survival results, using the metric “log hazard ratio” for the 10 studies identified that addressed the comparison of interest. Table 5.

The NI margin is therefore 1.09 for a fixed margin approach ruling out M1. A summary of the survival results based on the intent-to-treat populations for each of the two Xeloda NI trials is presented in Table 6. Study 2 rules out M 1 using a fixed margin approach, but Study 1 does not. Table 6.

The synthesis approach was used to analyze whether the NI criteria of 50% loss was met. This synthesis approach for each study combines the results of that NI study with the results from the random effects meta-analysis to produce a normalized test statistic. Based on this NI synthesis test procedure, NI Study 1 failed to demonstrate that Xeloda retained at least 50% of the historical effect of 5-FU+LV versus 5-FU on overall survival, but NI Study 2 did demonstrate such an effect. It was then decided to determine what percent retention was demonstrated. By adapting the synthesis test procedure for retention of an arbitrary percent of the 5-FU+LV historical effect, it was determined that NI Study 1 demonstrated that Xeloda lost no more than 90% of the historical effect of 5-FU+LV on overall survival and that NI Study 2 demonstrated no more than a 39% loss of the historical effect. The evidence of effectiveness of Xeloda was supported by the observation that the tumor response rates were statistically significantly greater for the Xeloda arm and the fact that Xeloda and 5-FU were structurally and pharmacologically very similar. 46 Example 4: Determination of an NI margin for Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia (CABP) When No Historical Trials Are Available This example illustrates the following points: • The use of risk differences as the metric for estimated treatment effects • The determination of the NI margin using observational data when no randomized, placebo-controlled trials of active control drugs are available Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) is an acute bacterial infection of the pulmonary parenchyma associated with chest pain, cough, sputum production, difficulty breathing, chills, rigors, fever, or hypotension, and is accompanied by the presence of a new lobar or multi-lobar infiltrate on a chest radiograph. FDA issued revised draft guidance for developing treatments of CAPB in 2014, and the appendix in that guidance describes in detail the justification for NI margins with respect to two endpoints: clinical response and mortality. 3 Historical data from nonrandomized studies of bacteremic and nonbacteremic patients with pneumococcal or lobar pneumonia were evaluated to justify NI margins for use in future CABP studies.

For the clinical response endpoint, historical data are relied upon not only to determine an acceptable NI margin but also to decide the time point following treatment at which non- inferiority should be assessed. For the mortality endpoint, margin determination is more straightforward and provided here for illustration. An area of uncertainty in evaluating historical data is the spectrum of bacterial pathogens that cause CABP today. In most of the historical studies, CABP was considered synonymous with pneumococcal pneumonia because S. pneumoniae was regularly identified. CABP is also caused by other pathogens such as H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, S. aureus, and M. catarrhalis, as well as atypical bacteria such as M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Legionella species. A fundamental assumption is that historical response rates in infections such as S. pneumoniae CABP are relevant to response rates in modern infections with sensitive organisms. Table 7 provides an overview of the historical studies available for estimation of mortality rates among both treated and untreated patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. In all of the studies, a significant mortality benefit was shown for patients treated with antibacterial drugs (including sulfonamides, penicillin, and tetracyclines) compared to patients who received no specific therapy (untreated). 3 See the revised draft guidance for industry Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia: Developing Drugs for Treatment. When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic. 47 Table 7. Mortality in Observational Studies of Pneumococcal Pneumonia Publication Population Mortality (%): Untreated Patients (Study Years) Mortality (%): Antibacterial- Treated Patients (Study Years) Treatment Difference Untreated-Treated (95% CI) Finland (1943) ≥ 12 years old bacteremic and nonbacteremic N=2,832 (1929-1940)* 41% N=1,220 (1939-1941) 17% (sulfonamides) 24% (21%, 27%) Dowling and Lepper (1951) ≥ 10 years old bacteremic and nonbacteremic N=1,087 (1939, 1940)* 30.5% N=1,274 (1938-1950) 12.3% (sulfonamides) N=920 (1938-1950) 5.1% (penicillins and tetracyclines) 18.2% (15%, 21%) 25.4% (22%, 28%) Austrian and Gold (1964) ≥ 12 years old bacteremic N=17 (1952-1962) 82% N=437 (1952-1962) 17% 65% (41%, 79%) * Historical control patients There are two limitations in the use of these data to determine an NI margin. First, only observational data are presented, and second, no recent studies were available, with the most recent dating to the 1960s. Significant improvements in the standard of care and the availability of better treatment options for patients with CABP compared to the preantibiotic era bring into question the relevance of these historical studies in estimating an active control effect with respect to mortality. In spite of these limitations, the mortality rates among the treated patient cohorts are reasonably consistent, ranging from 5% to 17% across the three decades represented. Mortality rates in the untreated cohorts are more variable. The older references provide estimates of 31% and 41%, while the more recent study gives an estimated mortality rate of 82%, but this estimate is based on a very small sample size (n=17). In the absence of any placebo-controlled trials of active control drugs in this disease area, it is not possible to estimate M 1 using the methods advocated in this guidance document (e.g., the 95%-95% method), but it is clear that the untreated mortality is substantial. Thus, based on the historical evidence described above, with the caveats noted about the nature and age of the studies, it is reasonable to assume that the mortality rate due to CABP, if left untreated, will be substantially higher than the rates observed among the treated cohorts. Use of an NI margin (M 2) of approximately 10% is therefore a valid approach for evaluating new treatments of CABP and would clearly represent an effect superior to no treatment as well as, based on clinical judgment, an appropriate clinical margin. 48 REFERENCES FOR EXAMPLES Example 1(A and B) The Boston Area Anticoagulation Trial for Atrial Fibrillation Investigators (1990). “The Effect of Low-Dose Warfarin on the Risk of Stroke in Patients with Nonrheumatic Atrial Fibrillation.” New Engl J Med 323, 1505-1511.
